From military industrial, to domestic infrastructure,  computer chips, vehicles, batteries, other electrical components, all dependent on minerals. \n\n\nFor everyone else who\u2019s interested, the short term play(s) will be now, and on Monday. The executive order signed last week on Thursday 3/20/25 states 10 days after the date of the order, a list will be composed of current domestic mineral \u201cproducers\u201d with operations to be expedited in any permits required to continue operations/ increase or start new operations. \n\nPersonally, my watchlist is comprised mostly of pennystocks due to the nature of the current industry. What I mean by this is generally speaking we as a country (USA) have outsourced much of the industrialization of the modern world to other countries with cheaper exports. Yes there are domestic producers that are larger, I\u2019m somewhat weary of the performance of these in the longer term. \n\nTo preface, I currently hold no positions as of yet, however last Friday 2/21/25 to last Monday 2/24/25 I scalped a pennystock (that I\u2019m not allowed to name) based on the EO news.\n\nThe only domestic non pennystock on my list is BHP, an elderly company that has the infrastructure to produce already. I\u2019m not holding currently due to lacker performance as well as looking to not make a play until the list comes out on Sunday. The other play I\u2019ve made is GGN which isn\u2019t domestic, but still a hedge as tariffs could generally increase the price of gold anyways as it already has for copper. And GGN pays a sweet dividend. \n\nIf anyone is interested in the mining watchlist I\u2019ll be playing, just look up domestic lithium, the pebble property (largest known copper deposit), or look up battery grade graphite. These are all separate operations fyi. \n\nI\u2019ve done DD but all of my favorite picks are literally pennystocks for the short term. And yet again, asides from BHP, pennystocks dependent on the executive order handing out permits to start production. \n\nAnyone who has some insight + non pennystock tickers feel free to comment. Thanks \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "So this might sound ridiculous \u2014 I\u2019ve been thinking about a slightly off the beaten path investing idea and wanted to get some feedback.\n\nI\u2019ve got two pets, and we don\u2019t currently have pet insurance for them. I\u2019ve done a bit of research on Trupanion (TRUP), and while I\u2019m still on the fence about their policies (they seem to up your rate regularly but that feels like it happens across the pet insurance industry annually)\u2026 I was wondering about a different approach: what if I just bought a share of Trupanion stock every month instead of paying for a policy?\n\nRight now, their stock is trading around $38, which is not close to what a typical monthly premium might cost. My thinking is that if my pets stay healthy, I\u2019m building equity in a company that stands to benefit from more people using pet insurance (which I genuinely feel will happen over time) \u2014 kind of like a self-funded safety net that grows with the industry. Worst case, I can sell the shares if I ever do face a big vet bill.\n\nCurious if anyone else has thought this way for like a different service or product or has any perspective on this idea \u2014 either as an investing strategy or should I just get a legit pet insurance. Is this dumb as hell? A waste of time? Somewhere in between? \n\nAppreciate any insights and feedback!",

            "Yes, this is dumb as hell.\n\nIf you can afford to eat the cost of any vet bills though, you don\u2019t need insurance. Insurance is for when the bill comes, it is catastrophic to you. From an actuarial perspective if you are a good underwriting risk that means you will on average give more money to the insurance company than they will pay to cover your vet costs.\n\nAs far as your investment thesis, this makes close to zero sense. Why would you use a pet insurance company stock as a pet veterinary cost savings account/fund?",
            "People in the UK pay for pet insurance (and if not insured pay 1,000s out of pocket). Vet fees have gone through the roof in the last decade because private equity has bought out all the independent practices and given the individual vets billing targets, and because the growth of insurance has encouraged the vets to bill increased amounts \n\nIf the us is less far along this cycle shares in pet insurers may be a good bet.",

            "Pet insurance is by definition a negative sum game for anyone buying it. You will on average be paying far more into it than you\u2019ll get back. It\u2019s only meant for people who can\u2019t afford a sudden big bill. You\u2019re much better off setting money aside yourself if possible.\n\nThat\u2019s said, $TRUP stock doesn\u2019t seem like a good place to hold vet funds imo. Way too much volatility.\n\nI have an account where I invest all the funds I have set aside for my dog, but it\u2019s in GIC\u2019s, money market, etc where if I need to pay $6k tomorrow for emergency surgery I know the money will be there.",

If anything, it should make equities more attractive long term.",

        "text": "# The Upcoming Wild Ride for Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT) and My Plan to Get a Ticket\n\n[DetectiveDoot Bailing Out of QUBT During the Pinnacle of Enjoyment, Slightly Before Disaster](https://preview.redd.it/dcdjc7283cre1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7af766e9ceac82d39215a2941952bb25eb383d1a)\n\n# \n\n\n\n**TLDR: This is an extremely high-risk play. I'm taking a degenerate, short-term bullish position on $QUBT and long-term short position on quantum computing stocks as a whole, with the anticipation of extremely volatile $QUBT price action soon.** \n\nCurrent Positions:\n\n\\- Short: mostly IONQ, with almost entirely put debit spreads\n\n\\- Degenerate short-term OTM calls: QUBT, rolling weekly\n\n\n\n# Quantum Companies are Bad\n\nI have returned after a couple years away to bring good tidings and some DD about a play I believe will have some extreme volatility in the coming two weeks. Over the past six or so months, quantum computing stocks have had a wild ride. Up 1200% down, [pimp slapped hard](https://qz.com/quantum-computing-stocks-nvidia-ceo-rigetti-dwave-ionq-1851771538), recovered some and currently teetering towards inevitable doom.\n\n  \nThat's right. They are all doomed. Overvalued, overhyped and **running out of steam**. You don't need me to tell you that these companies are trash. Many big names have been trashing the industry, [Martin Shkreli](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1895480382629556486) and [Kerrisdale Capital](https://www.kerrisdalecap.com/investments/ionq/) being two of the most notable.\n\n# Why Do I Care about QUBT\n\nWhile all of the quantum companies have little to show for their insane valuations, QUBT is a real gem. Despite missing last quarter's disappointing earnings of -$0.47/share (est. -$0.05) they maintain a respectable market cap of \\~$1.1B while having nothing to sell. \n\n\n\n***IF YOU READ ANYTHING ON THIS POST, READ THIS PARAGRAPH.*** Per the [S-8 filed 3/21/2025](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758009/000101376225001115/ea0235205-s8_quantum.htm), insiders for $QUBT were recently approved to sell their shares. **Only two insiders stated immediate intent to sell stock by this coming Monday (3/31/2025).** As of 3/27/2025 only one insider has sold, with the Chairman of the Board[ Yuping Huang selling 200,000 out of his 27-million currently owned shares two days ago](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758009/000196858225000237/xsl144X01/primary_doc.xml). The other insider expressing intent is a director who only owns 207,000 shares. **Assuming the Chairman is done selling, insider dilution shouldn't be a near-term worry, but is always possible.** Currently, [multiple firms are suing the shit](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=8f5ad3653710c57c&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1129US1129&sxsrf=AHTn8zpwApo4bS8d-5dXiXB8EM1N_8SZgg:1743160180622&q=qubt+lawsuit&tbm=nws&source=lnms&fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpmDtIGL1r84kuKz6yAcD_igefx-eKq1gCPHF3zhthFoneNn6lL83lY3KLybUMxCNDhMUtbCQQO9t_eGxoOP_s3rR9imLItfH1uBSfE1eodVtu3j9NNltXXuqTU0fP37mjBusR7Pi0GSAtMbdArRUTLOsC4dN4POVlfGKFb_2PiWfOtFnP-rmmP8j0Odsy8bbuGSebXg&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwi74uja0ayMAxUCCnkGHfJkOOIQ0pQJegQIIRAB&biw=1718&bih=1304&dpr=1) out of this company. Any insider selling this close to the unlock would just accelerate the dumpster fire. \n\nAs you can imagine, QUBT is being beaten down to oblivion. However, after scratching the surface it becomes apparent that there is ever mounting stress on QUBT short sellers. Below, I have a little spreadsheet w/ some relevant short data and some recent options flows depicting deep ITM call buying, which can be highly indicative of low liquidity.  \n\n\n|Short Interest|19%|as of 3/11/2025|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Cost-to-Borrow (Schwab)**|**250%+ (when available)**|**3/27/2025**|\n|**Reg SHO Threshold**|**Yes**|**???-3/27/2025 (can't download history)**|\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wx1o8ur5hcre1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c21e669f6e3413afe88f2db2182c5f8752315c6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhjgou46hcre1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6386ef702cc12b23199bba8eee25836f6143f675\n\n# Catalysts\n\nPositive News - LOL, Highly unlikely\n\nRetail Enthusiasm - Why I'm here\n\nShark Entry - Would be sick but also unlikely\n\n# My Plan\n\nThis stock is equivalent to the rides in Roller Coaster Tycoon that are designed to the idiotic launch patrons into the air, to their violent and fiery demise. My plan is to get a ticket and parachute out immediately when/if volatility climaxes. I'm being extremely risky here.\n\n# Positions\n\nNot posting my current $QUBT position as it expires today and I don't want some idiots to copy it. I am rolling later on today and I will send it to mods when I do. Posted IONQ short though, which I will roll to may OPEX next week\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/88yrs90z1fre1.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=99925337269c7fd2015f0b812b7293feeec38cad\n\n# Other positions\n\nShort: $SBUX\n\nLong: $COOP, $RYCEY, $OKLO covered-calls (LEAPS)\n\n",

        "title": "I believe that Coreweave is already underwater, and their IPO is an exit strategy for existing shareholders:",
        "text": "Coreweave is set to launch its IPO tomorrow at $40 per share. Its NVDIA backing sounds promising, but balance sheet constraints and shady collateral backing for massive loans can\u2019t be brushed off.\n\nCoreweave managed to skyrocket into the headlines over the past couple of years after solidifying its position as a significant AI player. This parabolic rise was, in part, thanks to a $2.3b loan collateralized by NVDIA GPUs. However, a simple google search of the collateral posted for this loan, Nvidia H100 tensor core gpu, will likely lead you to the same conclusion illustrated below.\n\nWhen Coreweave secured an initial $2.3b in cash from investors, they posted NVDA chips as collateral. The rapid cash injection buoyed them onto the AI scene relatively quickly. However, that form of collateral has proven itself to be less than fundamentally sound over the past couple of years.\n*Source: (https://www.reuters.com/technology/coreweave-raises-23-billion-debt-collateralized-by-nvidia-chips-2023-08-03/)*\n\nWhen Coreweave posted the NVDA chips as collateral in 2023, the value was marked-to-market at ~$47,000/processor. That same processor is now worth 30% less. For context - their total loan value came in at a whopping $7.6 billion near the end of 2024. Simply put: technology is advancing quickly, and the collateral is rapidly degrading in value. Additionally, the cost to rent these GPUs is falling - why own the asset when you can rent it for 1/100th the price?\n\nIn December of 2024, Coreweave breached terms of their $7.6b loan through various \"unspecified\" actions and \"accidents\". However, their primary lender Blackstone was generous enough to waive these shortcomings and amend their loan.\n*Source: (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798dex1015.htm)*\n\nWildly enough, the cause of the near technical default was found to be due to an overstatement of collateral - Coreweave was alleged to not have tangibly held as many GPUs as they reported. The \"administrative accident\" was Coreweave attempting to sure-up it's reserves as to avoid defaulting on it's obligations.\n\nThat same company, \"backed\" by NVDA, will now IPO tomorrow. At $40 per share, the implied value is $19b. As it stands today, that $7.6b loan (that they nearly defaulted on 3 months ago) is nearly 1/2 of their entire market cap.\n\nJust keep that in mind before smashing that buy button tomorrow after the buffer period.\n\n**It's not rocket appliances**\n\n",

            "The idea of the tariffs and trade war - seemingly appear to be a self created event (Trump's team creating the event) that will last a few months - and then through negotiations - Trump lifts the tariffs and tries to sell it as he is the master of the deal - when in reality, he created the mess with the sole purpose of trying to use a solution to appear to be the person that solved the mess.",
            "As someone who shorted telsa and lost all of it over a weekend I can explain why in 5 reasons in order.\n\nA) Shorting the market is based on supply and demand.   If everyone is shorting a stock the cost to short the stock is already baked in.   If a stock is practically guaranteed to go down,  then it costs more to short - the odds of the stock going down is baked into the price.  Everyone has the same idea,  there isnt free money to be made.\n\nB) When a market is overly shorted - everyone is shorting a stock,  then the market will notice and those with the stocks just wont sell,  or like Tesla - actually coordinate and buy more stock,  thus destroying all the shorts and making a large profit off those gambling it will go down.  Even though the company itself has no value,  there is profit to be made manipulating the market.   Almost always its manipulated by the big players but at least one one occasion the public manipulated it with GameStop.  Think of it like non main stream crypto currencies - there is no actual value in it,  the value is ability to gamble with the coin in the market.  Volatility is value because you can manipulate it.   Professionals and insiders will use volatility to make money.\n\nC) No one wants to lose billions of dollars.   Think this scene in the big short:  [https://youtu.be/F3goSYkVPNE?si=beiiBHP9V0ea3PWf](https://youtu.be/F3goSYkVPNE?si=beiiBHP9V0ea3PWf) \\- even when banks figured out that their bond values were worthless - the value maintained its price - because the banks didnt let the price fall through various means.   They will continue to profit off maintaining a price until its physically impossible not to.  Even the public when a stock is tanking dont sell - because there is a sunken cost fallacy,  or they may even buy because \"its so cheap\" not gambling on the value of the company but just straight up gambling.  People dont want to take a 50% loss,  the value of a stock maintains its value because it has value - the underlying assets dont matter on stocks that never had any value to begin with.  Using Tesla as an example,  it was never worth as much as all car companies combined by any metric,  its value is based on people who want to make money.  Everyone jumps on the money train,  no one wants to get off.\n\nD) You as the general public cant time the Rug pull.   The general public doesnt have 24/7 stock brokers monitoring the market with all sorts of contracts,  preferred stock,  millisecond trades using stop losses.  These people will ensure that they are covered before the rug gets pulled out from under the public.   Privatize gains,  socialize losses.   Unless your an insider you cant time when this happens and you wont be covered when it does unless your a professional.   At any given time,  these companies can announce a new project ( Telsa's Fake electric airplane for example ) or add tariff that excludes Tesla ( stock goes up ) or oh nevermind tarriffs arent happening... oh wait they are!  You can get screwed anytime... guessing the rug pull is luck.\n\nE)  Options trading ( shorting / buying ) is high risk and low profit - seriously - youll risk 100% of your money for a chance to make 10% - 10% is a good sell or youll lose everything multiple times for the 1/10 chance to make 100% on higher risk bets.   This is why you see so many people who make 100k or an even a million dollars and then they lose everything the next week.   At any time the risk of loss can easily outweigh the profit - and as stated above you can get screwed for so many things out of your control.   Sometimes market manipulation - sometimes literally just an act of God,  a death of public figure,  a natural disaster,  a war.  Who knows.",

        "text": "Interesting thought, STLA Stelantis has 19 manufacturing facilities in the U.S(Michigan Ohio and Indiana) from these plants they could technically build some of their other brands here to cut the 25% tariffs on imports. \n\nStellantis manufactures vehicles under several brands outside the U.S., with production facilities in Europe, South America, and Asia.\n\nEurope\n\t\u2022\tPeugeot (France, Spain, Slovakia)\n\t\u2022\tCitro\u00ebn (France, Spain, Slovakia)\n\t\u2022\tOpel/Vauxhall (Germany, UK, Poland)\n\t\u2022\tFiat (Italy, Poland, Serbia, Turkey)\n\t\u2022\tAlfa Romeo (Italy)\n\t\u2022\tMaserati (Italy)\n\t\u2022\tJeep (Italy - some models like the Avenger)\n\nSouth America\n\t\u2022\tFiat (Brazil, Argentina)\n\t\u2022\tJeep (Brazil - Renegade, Compass, Commander)\n\t\u2022\tPeugeot & Citro\u00ebn (Argentina, Brazil)\n\nAsia\n\t\u2022\tJeep (India, China - localized models)\n\t\u2022\tPeugeot (China, Malaysia)\n\t\u2022\tCitro\u00ebn (China, India)\n\t\u2022\tDongfeng-Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn (China, under joint venture)\n\nStellantis has a strong presence in Europe due to its legacy brands (Fiat, Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn, Opel) and also maintains production in emerging markets like Brazil and China.\u201d\n\nIf they are already making Fiat and Jeep in Brazil(hint this is to avoid tariffs in Brazil) what\u2019s to say they do not do the same in the US. I think of all of the car companies going through these tariffs and uncertainty stelantis are positioned well location wise, financially, debt wise and value wise.\n-cash on hand is $34 billion\n-assets $207b\n-total debt $37b(has increased due to England location issues)\n-market cap $44b(can almost buy the whole company outright with their cash on hand )\n-sitting at a 6.18 P/E\n-paying 13% dividend(24) has lowered to about 6% this year, I consider this a smart move (why give out larger dividends now vs taking on larger debt at interest if needed in future) this is a smarter use from managment with market uncertainty\u2019s.\n\nAt $11.44 at the time of writing, this guy is taking this bull for a spin.\n\nDisclosure I am invested in STLA long term, do your own DD, for discussion purposes only, not financial advice",

All legacy US makers and many suppliers have been heavily using Mexico as a production base for cost sensitive models.\nThese tariffs will raise the price of most cars. Tesla might face a lower impact as it's mostly built in the US with US parts.",

We will lose those market shares and never get them back.\u00a0\n\n\nSo the US will only have American cars with American parts for sale in the United States, but we will not really sell any to the rest of the world."

At the same they issued their quartermy dividend and the whole market was panik red.\n\nYou get the point, they were \"unrightfully\" oversold.\n\nSo my theory is that it can, in a matters of month rebound to a price around 26-27 due to these :\n\n1- oversold yet fundamentals are good\n\n2- in case of uncertain and bearish market investor tend to like energy stock and you can see a rise in volume\n\n3- they focus on domestic production wich can be boosted by the tax war, focus on april 2\n\n4- 90% of reddit talk about Raw material or some goofy biotech with the 35th potential cure for cancer or whatever\n\n5- insiders are stock pilling like crazy\n\nPosition : 400 april-17 25c  snatched at 0.13ct not selling until 10 baggers, might revise depending on momentum and market.\nI recomend going on a longer date now that monday was a big green stick\n\nDisclaimer : not a financial advise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "I also want to make an important point here.\n\nEven if the car model is assembled in the US (example, the Ford Explorer), the raw materials and parts that go into it will be subjected to the tariff.\n\nThe automakers get their steel and aluminum from outside the US, they get the electronics outside of the US, they get the paint outside of the US, they get the silica sand for glass and casting outside of the US.\n\nThere is no way any car buyer will be able to avoid the effect of the tariffs. I repeat, there is no way any car buyer will be able to avoid the effect of the tariff. And on top of that, when a final assembled vehicle imported into the US becomes 25% more expensive, companies which assemble their particular models in the US, on top of the tariff increases on the materials and parts, will increase the price even further on top b/c now the competition will be more expensive.\n\nSimple math calculates that an Ontario-built base model RAV4, will now cost USD $40,000 at your local dealer. Besides the Ford Escape (assembled in Kentucky) increasing in price due to the cost of the tariffs on the materials and parts, Ford will add further price increases so they can be just a bit under the price of the RAV4. So a Ford Escape built in the US, should be -$10,000 cheaper than the tariffed RAV4, but instead Ford will increase their price by +$5,000 or more, blame it on the tariffs and advertise it still being cheaper than the RAV4.\n\nWinners: Ford and other companies whose models are made in the US. Their profits will soar, and they won't need to hire anyone extra to do so\n\nLosers: Everyone who buys vehicles. And anyone who voted for this, thinking it would bring back American good paying manufacturing jobs when in fact nothing happened except inflation",

            "Youre looking at it wrong imo. I think a lot of retail going to get burned on this same play. Everyone and their mother knows tariffs are coming on 4/2. The question is are they meaningfully more/less impactful than expected. There is a baseline impact that is priced into the market right now. This is an extremely hard question to answer and 99% of the regards on here have no clue. Even institutions largely have no clue. To answer this question you need to have a feel for A. what level of tariffs is priced in, and B. what level of tariffs will actually be implemented. Thinking you have a real grasp on either let alone both of those things is delusional for 99.99% of people.\n\nA lot of regards playing this same narrative \"tariff come 4/2. surely market dump\" - IMO there is a very real possibility we pump massively because tariffs could be more tame than what is priced in.

        "text": "NVDA is down 1.8% premarket at the time I am publishing this.\n\nOver the last two days, I rolled 30 of 40 NVDA 5/16 110 csps (cash secured puts) to NVDA 5/16 120 csps and received an additional $11k premium. Wrote another 30 NVDA 5/16 110 csps for $9k premium. Altogether 40 NVDA 5/16 110 csps and 30 NVDA 5/16 120 csps for a total of $35k premium. I picked the expiration to be one week before earnings so the premiums are not inflated by earnings and I would like to have the option to make another earnings play if the price is around $120.\n\nAfter factoring in premiums, the average cost to purchase is $105 and $115 respectively. I picked $110 and $120 because NVDA\u2019s lower range is around $110 and upper range is around $140, so in the worst case (of my) scenario, I would be purchasing NVDA at the lower end of the range. If I\u2019m wrong, then NVDA is a good stock to hold long term.\n\nI don\u2019t need to bore anyone to list all of the reasons NVDA is a buy including exploding need and revenue from data centers; just beginning to scratch surface on AI in automobiles/partnership with AI companies; growing domestic revenue (47% 63B revenue) that won\u2019t be impacted by AI restrictions\u2026\n\nWorst case scenario, NVDA tanks below $110 and I am forced to buy 7,000 more shares. In that case I will just hold on to a stock that I am confident will double in 5 years. Best case scenario for me is if the price remains in the 129 range and I will get to write puts again (6th time) and continue to collect premiums.\n\n",

        "title": "$AVXL - Alzheimer\u2019s Drug that Actually Works - Pending EMA Approval",
        "text": "\n1. Introduction to Blarcamesine\n\nBlarcamesine, also known as ANAVEX\u00ae2-73, is an investigational oral therapy developed by Anavex Life Sciences. It functions as an agonist of the sigma-1 (SIGMAR1) receptor and muscarinic receptors, aiming to restore cellular homeostasis disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n**Additional reading:** https://www.sotcanalytics.com/\n\n2. Clinical Trial Insights\n\nA pivotal Phase 2b/3 randomized clinical trial evaluated blarcamesine\u2019s efficacy in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) patients over 48 weeks. The results were promising:\n\t\u2022\tCognitive Benefits: Blarcamesine significantly slowed clinical progression by 36.3% at 48 weeks, indicating a notable preservation of cognitive function.  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tSafety Profile: The therapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no significant neuroimaging adverse events reported.  \ufffc\n\t\u2022\tSIGMAR1 Wild-Type Subgroup Analysis: In a prespecified analysis focusing on patients with the common SIGMAR1 wild-type gene (excluding carriers of the mutated SIGMAR1 rs1800866 variant), blarcamesine exhibited an even greater clinical benefit. These patients experienced a 49.8% reduction in clinical progression at 48 weeks on the primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13. **This represents over 70% of the patient population.** \n\nThese results were published in a peer reviewed journal article over 50 doctors/researchers  representing 42 external organizations: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2274580724006083\n\n3. Market Potential\n\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s therapeutics market is poised for substantial growth:\n\t\u2022\tCurrent and Projected Market Size: Valued at approximately $4.05 billion in 2022, the market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.99%, reaching around $15.19 billion by 2030.\n\t\u2022\tValuation of Alzheimer\u2019s Drugs: An FDA-approved Alzheimer\u2019s drug can carry a market value of approximately $43.4 billion. For instance, Biogen\u2019s Aducanumab was valued at this figure upon approval. Similarly, drugs in Phase 3 trials, like Eli Lilly\u2019s Donanemab, have been valued around $20.2 billion, with potential increases upon receiving Breakthrough Therapy Designation.\n\n**AVXL inexplicably has a market cap under $1B with over 25% of the float short**. If they even sniff the valuations argued here, we\u2019re looking at a triple digit share price. \n\nhttps://ipwatchdog.com/2021/10/26/assessing-much-alzheimers-drug-worth/id=139154/\n\n4. Investment Considerations\n\nInvestors should monitor:\n\t\u2022\tRegulatory Milestones: Blarcamesine has received EMA filing acceptance for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, marking a significant step toward potential market approval. **A decision should be made by the end of 2025** \n\n\t\u2022    Upcoming conference on April 5th which Anavex is expected to reveal additional subgroup analysis of their trial. \n\n5. Conclusion\n\nBlarcamesine represents a compelling candidate in the Alzheimer\u2019s therapeutics sector. Its innovative mechanism of action, coupled with favorable clinical trial results, positions it as a potential frontrunner in addressing a significant unmet medical need. Given the substantial market valuations observed with similar drugs, blarcamesine\u2019s successful development and approval could yield considerable financial returns.\n\nCorporate presentation: https://www.anavex.com/_files/ugd/79bcf7_da38b4e0ad4b4ff888363403e3962ef2.pdf\n\nP.S. - yes I know Martin Shkreli is short.

They are somehow managing to trap the retail virgin. How can a stock skyrocket 13% literally after they announce that they lost 44% sales in Europe? When $INTC reported an 8b loss, it lost 30% valuation in 30 minutes. Intuitive Machine($LUNR) lost 50% valuation because they didn't land something on the moon, idk.\n\nAt 3:05PM I noticed a 12M BUY Volume on $TSLA on my Robinhood App. The same thing happened yesterday on closing, someone bought 2M stock. This is not retail investor, This is Elmo and \ud83e\udd6d cooking up some massive scam which is going to completely cook the retail investor and us, WSB Put buyers. I have made good money buying $TSLA puts but today I have made the cumulative decision to stay away from them. \n\nElmo is planning something big and our PUTS will be fucked. \n\nI felt that one of us must address this problem and warn the others about Elmo.",

            "here's the full text :  \n  \nThey\u2019re at it again. \u201cMicroStrategy Incorporated d/b/a Strategy\u201d \u2014 the enterprise software company turned bitcoin maximalist \u2014 has announced a new financial instrument to raise money to buy more bitcoin. It\u2019s called Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock.\u00a0 \u201cStrife\u201d? \u201cPerpetual Strife\u201d? Matt Levine at Bloomberg had initially suspected a typo when he read it, but 23 references in the document suggest not. Maybe it\u2019s an inside joke \u2014 the kind of thing that sounds clever at 5am at an after-party. Or perhaps it\u2019s an unwittingly honest nod to the drama surrounding the company\u2019s relentless bitcoin accumulation. The bizarro name isn\u2019t the only head-scratcher. Strife comes with quirks that set it apart from Strategy\u2019s previous fundraising efforts. For one, it\u2019s not your typical (Micro)Strategy dilutive equity issuance; unlike the perpetual strike preferred securities (STRK), it is not convertible into common stock. Michael Saylor, executive chair, has pitched it as a way to tap into the vast pool of fixed-income investors who generally prefer stability and predictable returns. Yet Strife offers neither. It exposes investors to bitcoin\u2019s downside (since Strategy\u2019s creditworthiness hinges on its crypto holdings) without giving them any upside if the cryptocurrency soars. The dividend is fixed, so if bitcoin \u201cmoons\u201d, Strife holders are left watching from the sidelines. It\u2019s like being invited to an all-you-can-eat buffet but only allowed to smell the food. The dividend structure is another oddity. Unlike Strategy\u2019s STRK, where dividends could be paid in cash or stock at the company\u2019s discretion, Strife dividends are strictly cash-only. The instrument offers a 10 per cent annual payout, but there\u2019s a catch: if the company defers payment, the dividend rate increases by one per cent per year, capping at 18 per cent. Buried in the fine print of the prospectus is a crucial detail: the board can suspend dividends altogether. It\u2019s essentially a \u201ctrust me\u201d deal.\u00a0 \\[O\\]ur board of directors or any duly authorized committee thereof may choose not to pay accumulated dividends on the perpetual strife preferred stock for any reason. Accordingly, we may pay less than the full amount of accumulated dividends on the perpetual strife preferred stock. In addition, if we fail to declare and pay accumulated dividends on the perpetual strife preferred stock in full, then the value of the perpetual strife preferred stock will likely decline. Investors can\u2019t say they weren\u2019t warned. And where is the cash for these dividends supposed to come from? According to recent filings, MicroStrategy has less than $50mn in cash, and its legacy software business is bleeding money. Servicing a 10 per cent yield on $500mn of preferred stock will require creative financing. The company apparently intends to fund the dividend not from operating cash flow like a normal company, but rather by selling more stock or other dilutive securities:\u00a0 We expect to fund any dividends paid in cash on the perpetual strife preferred stock primarily through additional capital raising activities, including, but not limited to, at-the-market offerings of our class A common stock and our perpetual strike preferred stock. Issuing equity to keep the peace on Strife would be highly dilutive, and that is on top of the dilution from the dividends on STRK. As for convertible bonds, the market already feels saturated with Strategy\u2019s equity-linked paper, and issuing more would simply add leverage to service a dividend lower in the capital stack.\u00a0 Still, Strategy has managed to assemble an impressive roster of underwriters, including Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Citigroup, and Moelis, with Fidelity as a selling agent to retail investors. This suggests either investor enthusiasm for Saylor\u2019s bitcoin-centric vision \u2014 or, at the very least, an appreciation for the fees the company is willing to pay Wall Street. Strife is a fascinating \u2014 if baffling \u2014 addition to Strategy\u2019s playbook. It seems to defy financial logic, offering fixed-income investors an instrument with an unfavourably asymmetric return profile and piling on more dilution for common stockholders. But given the firm\u2019s all-in bet on crypto, perhaps \u201cPerpetual Strife\u201d is the perfect name. When you\u2019re staking everything on bitcoin, a little chaos is inevitable.",

Why I\u2019m Playing This**  \n- **Earnings Momentum:** TTD surged **20%+ post-Q1** (May 2024) on ad-tech strength.  \n- **Technical Setup:** Broke $65 resistance; next stop **$70-75** (pre-ATH zone).  \n- **Catalyst Potential:** Summer streaming demand (Olympics, Netflix ads, etc.).  \n\n\n **2. Position Math**  \n- **Breakeven:** **$74.80** ($70 strike + $4.80 premium).  \n- **Profit Potential:**  \n  - At **$70**: Calls worth ~$3.00 (-37.5%, but salvageable).  \n  - At **$75**: Calls worth ~$5.20 (+8% + intrinsic value).  \n  - At **$80**: Calls worth ~$10.20 (+112%).  \n- **Max Risk:** **$48,000** (if TTD \u2264 $70 by July 19).  \n\n\n**3. Why 100 Contracts?**  \n- **High Conviction:** Expecting volatility squeeze toward $70+.  \n- **Liquidity Managed:** Using limit orders to avoid slippage (bid-ask: $4.75/$4.85).  \n- **Exit Plan:** Scale out at $6.00 (25% gain), $8.00 (67% gain), etc.  \n\n\n **4. Risks I\u2019m Watching**  \n\u26a0\ufe0f **Theta Decay:** Losing ~$1.00/week in July (accelerates fast).  \n\u26a0\ufe0f **Low Volume:** Open Interest = [X] \u2013 may need to exit early.  \n\u26a0\ufe0f **Macro Risks:** Weak ad spend data or market pullback.  \n\n\n**5. Trade Management**  \n\u2705 **Added Stop Loss:** Auto-sell 50% if TTD < $63.  \n\ud83c\udfaf **Profit Targets:**  \n- **25% at $6.00** (sell 25 contracts).  \n- **50% at $7.50** (sell 50 contracts).  \n- **Let runners ride** if $75+ breakout.  \n\ud83d\udd04 **Hedge:** Considering $75 puts if market turns.  \n\n\n **6. Why Post This Now?**  \n- **Accountability:** Putting my money where my mouth is.  \n- **Discussion:** Are others playing TTD? Better ideas?  \n- **Transparency:** No pump\u2014just sharing my thesis.  \n\n---  \n\n**Final Thoughts**  \n**Bull Case:** TTD\u2019s CTV growth justifies $75+.  \n**Bear Case:** $4.80 premium is steep\u2014needs a strong move.  \n**My Bet:** Worth the risk for a **10-20%+ move in 4 weeks**.  \n\n**What\u2019s Your Take?**  \n- *\"Would you hold or hedge this position?\"*  \n- *\"Is $70 realistic by July?\"*  \n- *\"Any red flags I missed?\"*  \n\n\n**Let\u2019s debate!** \ud83d\ude80  ",

        "title": "Thoughts on Quantum Computing - from a Physicist",
        "text": "*New post, now with screenshot.*\n\nMy background: PhD student in Physics, working on quantum information on the theory side. I do know many friends that work on the experimental side, though.\n\nAs much as I appreciate the interest in my field over the last year or so, I personally think it's best to keep expectations realistic. Especially with some DD posts I have seen posting incomplete information, and even blatantly false statements (in Physics). I want to clear those up and some personal thoughts on some quantum computing startups.\n\n**Quantum communication doesn't allow for faster-than-light propagation of information**\n\nI have seen a DD post that says IonQ achieved faster than light communication via networked entanglement of particles. VERY common misconception about entanglement. Affecting one particle in a pair of entangled particles does not affect the other, it will just break the entanglement. It is proven to be impossible via the [no-communication theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem).\n\n**Breaking Cryptography, more like breaking your portfolio as you baghold for 10-20 years**\n\nYes, Shor's algorithm is real. No, it won't be possible to break encryption until we get a quantum computer with at least 2000 qubits. The most optimal implementations  of Shor's algorithm requires around 2n qubits to factor an n-bit number.\n\nAs an example for RSA-1024, you'll need more than 2000 LOGICAL qubits. Factoring in error correction, which requires multiple PHYSICAL qubits to represent one single logical qubit, you'll most likely need upwards of 100k physical qubits before we can actually break real-world encryption. I personally see that taking at least 20 years, but some more optimistic estimates place it at 10 years.\n\n**IonQ**\n\nThere's many DD touting IonQ's lower error rates, longer lifetimes, and all-to-all connectivity. While all of these are true, they often forget to mention one drawback: the gate speeds.\n\nIt takes around a thousand times longer to execute an operation on trapped ion platforms compared to superconducting platforms (which Google, IBM uses). While finance/techbros that have never touched a quantum mechanics textbook will point to the fact that the lifetime of the qubit is at most on the order of 100 seconds, and think that quantum algorithms won't require more than that time anyways, so this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the algorithms that are most likely to see real-world use are optimization algorithms like VQE and QAOA. These algorithms need to repeat the quantum circuit many, many times as they gradually change the parameters in the circuit to find the optimal set of solutions.\n\nFurthermore, if your circuit output is some continuous variable that's encoded into the probability of measuring one of the states, then you need to repeat the circuit upwards of thousands of time to get a good estimate of that probability.\n\nAs a conservative estimate for a simple optimization algorithm, let's say that you need 1000 repetitions of the circuit, each one taking 1000 repetitions to get the output, and each run of the circuit takes 1 second on a trapped ion computer. That takes 11 and a half days on a trapped ion computer, as compared to 17 minutes on a superconducting one. If we use a pay-by-the-minute model in the future for quantum computers, then IonQ likely has to charge less per minute, since you need more time to run an algorithm on their platform. Sure, they can charge a premium for the lower error rates, but if they charge the same amount per minute as superconducting platforms, then customers are likely to simplify the algorithm they want to run (to be more tolerant of errors) to get a solution at a thousandth of the price.\n\n**Rigetti**\n\nHonestly, looking at their spec sheets for their platforms, and comparing it to Google's and IBM's, I don't see them pulling ahead at any point. Their board also literally kicked out the original founder for (allegedly) being a prick in general.\n\n**QUBT**\n\nLiterally never seen any substantial work from them.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8d3hedfi4rqe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5c6f4e97de5dba5f0aa1ce08d44b6e959d16f03\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThis is not financial advice. I've literally got my portfolio tied up in RKLB and LUNR because I don't know anything about space outside of Kerbal Space Program. I don't invest in quantum because I know quantum. I invest in space because I don't know space. Someone please make a similar post about space to convince me that space is bad too so I'll finally put my money into VOO and QQQ.",

I believe I\u2019ll make a of minimum 2x off this investment.\n\nvalaris (val) is the largest offshore drilling contractor by fleet size, operating 53 rigs, including 18 floaters (13 drillships and 5 semisubmersibles) and 35 jackups. the company provides contract drilling services to major oil companies such as exxonmobil, chevron, bp, shell, petrobras, and equinor. following a downturn in the offshore drilling industry and a 2020 bankruptcy restructuring, valaris emerged with no long-term debt, a modernized fleet, and an improving financial position, allowing it to capitalize on the offshore drilling recovery.\n\noffshore drilling fundamentals are improving as the supply of rigs has tightened significantly. a decade ago, the global offshore fleet consisted of approximately 300 vessels, but that number has now dropped to around 150, with only 120-130 of them actively operational. meanwhile, demand for offshore drilling has rebounded, leading to a sharp increase in day rates, which are the prices oil companies pay to lease a drilling rig per day. since 2022, drillship day rates have doubled from around $250k per day to $500k per day. during the last cycle, they peaked at $800k per day, and current market conditions suggest they could reach $900k per day. offshore drilling has also become more cost-competitive, with breakeven prices of around $40 per barrel, compared to $60 per barrel for most u.s. shale projects.\n\nvalaris has one of the strongest financial positions in the industry. unlike competitors such as transocean, which is burdened with over $6.5 billion in debt, valaris currently operates with minimal net debt relative to industry peers, giving it a major advantage in capital allocation and flexibility. despite its strong position, the company remains deeply undervalued. with an enterprise value of approximately $5.1 billion compared to an estimated $30 billion replacement cost for its fleet, valaris is currently trading at just 16 cents on the dollar relative to its assets. management has been actively repurchasing shares, reducing the share count by around 5% since 2021, and the company maintains a buyback yield of approximately 5%, further enhancing shareholder value.\n\nvaluation metrics further support the investment case. based on projected fcf, valaris is trading at a p/fcf of about 10x for 2025 and 4x for 2026. ev/ebitda ratio stands at around 5x for 2025 and is expected to drop to 3x in 2026, whereas industry peers typically trade at 8-10x. net asset value analysis suggests a target enterprise value of around $27 billion, implying a potential 7x upside from current levels.\n\nif drillship day rates continue their upward trajectory and approach $900k per day, applying a peak-cycle nav multiple of 1.5x would imply an enterprise value of approximately $27 billion, which translates to a share price of around $500, representing a 10x return from current levels. in a more conservative scenario where day rates stabilize between $600k and $700k per day, a 1.25x nav multiple would still yield an enterprise value of $18 billion to $22 billion, implying a share price in the range of $250 to $350, or a 5-7x return. even in a bearish case where day rates hold at $500k per day, applying a 1.0x nav multiple would still result in an enterprise value of $14 billion to $18 billion, meaning the stock could reach $150 to $200 per share, offering a 2-3x return from current levels.\n\nthere are risks to consider, such as oil price volatility, which could affect offshore drilling demand. however, offshore projects now have lower breakevens than shale, making them more resilient to price fluctuations. execution risk is another factor, as management must continue optimizing capital allocation and fleet utilization. additionally, the market may take time to recognize the disconnect between valaris\u2019s asset value and its current share price.\n\ndespite these risks, valaris presents one of the most compelling deep-value opportunities in the market. it is trading well below its asset value while benefiting from rising day rates, improving financials, and aggressive share buybacks. in a conservative scenario, the stock has 2-3x upside, while in a more bullish offshore drilling cycle, it could rise 5-10x from current levels. with strong industry tailwinds and a clean balance sheet, valaris offers an asymmetric risk-reward opportunity that is rare in today\u2019s market.\n\ni believe offshore drilling is the best investment opportunity over the next couple years and im all in.",

Strong cash position.\n\n# Addressing the Impact of the Semaglutide Shortage Ending\n\nOn\u00a0February 21, 2025, the FDA declared the semaglutide shortage over. This was big news for Hims & Hers, as it came just days before their earnings call. While the timing was unexpected, it ultimately worked in HIMS\u2019 favor, allowing management to adjust guidance and directly answer difficult questions on the call.\n\n**What Was the Semaglutide Shortage, and Why Does It Matter?**\n\nPharmaceutical companies are incentivized through patents, which grants them exclusive rights to sell patented drugs and recoup the costs of research and development. For example, Novo Nordisk holds the patent for Ozempic (semaglutide) until 2031. However, if the drug is in high demand and the company is unable to meet supply, the FDA can declare a shortage. This allows generic compounded versions of the drug to be sold by other companies, even while under patent protection. This allows companies like HIMS to sell their own generic GLP-1 to help meet the demand of the drug during a supply shortage.\n\nWith Novo Nordisk now claiming they can meet demand; the FDA has removed semaglutide from the shortage list. As a result, companies like HIMS can no longer sell compounded generics commercially.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a legal loophole:\n\n* Semaglutide is commercially available in fixed doses (0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, 1.7mg, and 2.4mg).\n* If a specific prescribed dose is unavailable, it can still be compounded and sold.\n\nSince HIMS specializes in personalization, many of its GLP-1 prescriptions are in personalized, custom dosages. HIMS has committed to continuing to provide these dosages where clinically necessary.\n\nCEO Andrew Dudum has made it clear that while HIMS can no longer sell commercial dosages of GLP-1, that they will continue providing personalized prescriptions where clinically necessary.\n\nOn the earnings call, CFO Yemi Okupe emphasized this point: ***\u201cWhat we see in general in our platform is, as Andrew mentioned, many of the folks that are coming to our platform have come and have had struggles with GLP-1s in the past. That was the genesis behind one of the reasons behind why we very quickly looked to roll out the personalized dosages as well.****\"*\n\nHe also noted that \u201ca majority of individuals on the platform today are utilizing personalized dosages versus the commercially available dosages.\u201d\n\n**Example of HIMS GLP-1 Onboarding Regimen:**\u00a0Note the customized dosages.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/us2f3qls1oqe1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=04cc45df6496f7af09aaa3d41c9fe77081842837\n\n# The Financial Impact of GLP-1\n\nMy prior estimate for GLP-1 Revenue as of Q3 2024 was 10-15% of total revenue. The company has now confirmed $225 million in GLP-1 revenue for 2024, approximately 15% of total FY24 revenue.\n\n*Subscriber growth and revenue growth existed prior to GLP-1 announcements and offerings at HIMS.* HIMS has been a disruptive and rapidly growing company before introducing GLP-1 into the equation.\n\nOf note: GLP-1 was primarily a revenue and subscriber driver in the short term with compressed margins due to initial investment costs. The company has made it clear that economies of scale take time for new product lines.\n\n**Gross Margin Compression from 82% to 79.45% YoY.**\u00a0Expected per HIMS due to GLP-1.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uev7s8sv1oqe1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4bc59ed9a5dfccd2c7cea498c132351bb751368\n\nI believe that GLP-1 \u2018hype\u2019 certainly fueled much of the recent stock craze surrounding HIMS but it was not, and has not been, a core tenet of my thesis for the investment. HIMS is well-positioned to adapt, already planning to:\n\n* Continue offering personalized GLP-1 dosages.\n* Bring back commercial GLP-1\u00a0with any new shortage.\n* Expand its weight loss portfolio, emphasizing its\u00a0oral weight loss medications\u00a0(already generating\u00a0$100M+ in revenue\u00a0within seven months of launch).\n* Introduce liraglutide\u00a0as an alternative weight loss treatment in 2025.\n\nWhile there will be customers that leave HIMS, many customers who initially joined for GLP-1 are expected to transition to other offerings.\n\n# Debunking the \u201cNo Moat\u201d Argument\n\nI disagree with the idea that HIMS lacks a competitive moat\u2026\n\n# Brand & Marketing Moat\n\nWhile I have been aware of HIMS since IPO, it first caught my attention as an investment opportunity due to its standout marketing strategy. HIMS has executed on a marketing strategy that has created a strong, trusted brand. Simply put, HIMS makes Erectile Dysfunction medicine \u201ccool\u201d rather than clinical or embarrassing.\n\nHIMS has positioned itself with a first mover advantage in the personalized healthcare and wellness industry. Its focus on:\n\n* Personalized treatments\n* Combination medications\n* Direct-to-consumer accessibility\n\n\u2026makes it a unique player in the telehealth space.\n\n# Convenience & Consumer Experience\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system is a nightmare for many - complicated, expensive, and frustrating. Long wait times, insurance headaches, and unclear pricing leave patients feeling powerless. HIMS provides an alternative with a consumer-first approach that eliminates these barriers.\n\n* Accessibility \u2013 No waiting rooms. No insurance approvals. Just frictionless, direct-to-consumer care.\n* Discretion \u2013 Patients can access treatments privately and comfortably.\n* Transparent Pricing \u2013 Consumers know exactly what they\u2019re paying before they commit.\n\nUnlike traditional healthcare, where patients feel like passive participants, HIMS allows consumers to take control of their health.\n\nThe out-of-pocket cost of care continues to rise, with more Americans opting for high-deductible plans. As co-pays and other expenses grow faster than inflation, affordability is an increasing concern. HIMS is well-positioned within this cash-pay segment, offering upfront pricing and a premium experience.\n\nFrom discreet online consultations to direct-to-door delivery, HIMS is designed for convenience. Consumers can browse treatments, receive personalized recommendations, and have medications shipped - all from their phone or computer. This retail-like approach makes healthcare as simple as shopping online, removing the stigma and complexity that often deter people from seeking treatment.\n\nUnlike traditional telehealth models that feel transactional and impersonal, HIMS created a premium consumer engagement. Rather than passively following doctor\u2019s orders, users customize their care, select treatments, and interact with a brand that prioritizes them.\n\nIn a world where convenience, transparency, and trust drive consumer decisions, HIMS offers a modern and approachable healthcare experience, a key differentiator.\n\nI believe HIMS has and is continuing to grow their brand moat as a trusted, transparent, premium, personalized health and wellness provider that brings a consumer experience to the healthcare system.\n\n# Regarding Share Dilution: A Manageable Concern\n\nHIMS has been diluting shares at about 8% per year, which isn\u2019t ideal. It is important to understand that HIMS is a young, high-growth company that is utilizing Share Based Compensation to attract, retain, and incentivize talent. Free cash flow growth is rapidly outpacing share-based compensation. I believe the impact of Shared Based Compensation to be reasonable and manageable and will minimize over time.\n\n[Source: Qualtrim](https://preview.redd.it/gs1g69sz1oqe1.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbd85d1e0b100862e5900d7d616544d3c0d2c14f)\n\n[Source: Qualtrim](https://preview.redd.it/a4jetk112oqe1.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=794186a27687540216913ae098d66024a4284234)\n\n# 2025 Outlook:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g7tpgw242oqe1.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=2512ebd9e99316590d7c4134fe30f9507bce8592\n\n# Growth Opportunities & Catalysts\n\n* **Total Addressable Market (TAM):** 100M+ Americans suffer from weight-related health problems.\n* **New Categories:** HIMS plans to launch 1-2 major new categories annually. Of focus with new acquisitions: low testosterone, menopause support, and peptides.\n* **At-Home Lab Testing:** New service offering that will support fricitionless access to hormonal treatment via HIMS while expanding personalized, data-driven care. Paired with MedMatch, HIMS' AI-driven treatment-matching service, at-home lab testing enhances the ability to identify additional products for consumer benefit. Utilizing data to personalize the consumer experience, increasing offerings and awareness of appropriate products based on data driven needs may lead to increased cross selling.\n* **Subscription Growth:** CEO Andrew Dudum aims for 10M subscribers, a realistic target based on historical trends. On the earnings call, Dudum noted: ***\"I think 10 million subs on the platform to me feels really quite in reach. And I think, frankly, pretty straightforward from a growth standpoint if you look at historical growth over the last five to six years. My optimistic hope and personally ambition would be to try to achieve this in the next five to six years.\"***\n\nIn addition, average revenue per subscriber is becoming a larger driver of revenue growth: ***\"While the addition of subscribers remains the primary component of our growth, monthly online average revenue per subscriber is becoming a more meaningful contributor as well. Monthly online average revenue per subscriber increased 38% year-over-year to $73 in the fourth quarter.\"***\n\nThis is a positive long-term trend, though the recent spike was undoubtedly impacted by the sales of higher-priced GLP-1 products.\n\n[Source: Qualtrim](https://preview.redd.it/689lrlqc2oqe1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=53e2ef0e32bf3061e65ef8c5dcc520a33fe9943a)\n\n# Risks & Challenges\n\n* **Regulatory Risk:** As always, there are regulatory risks for healthcare companies (and opportunities - i.e. favorable changes to compounding regulations).\n* **GLP-1 Competition:** Commercial semaglutide providers are working hard to limit access to compounded GLP-1. In addition, a direct-to-consumer cash option for Wegovy has been released but remains more than 2x the cost of HIMS offering. (Again, I see GLP-1 as a bonus here, not a core tenet of the HIMS thesis.)\n* **Execution Risk:** The recent FDA ruling on GLP-1 has put HIMS under increased scrutiny. Fortunately, the decision came before earnings, allowing the company to adjust its guidance and answer questions. Despite this, HIMS maintained a strong outlook, reflecting confidence in its execution of weight-loss products. While I\u2019ve never viewed HIMS as purely a GLP-1 investment, it will be important to see how their estimations of personalized GLP-1 offerings and transition to aliterate weight loss products delivers.\n\n# Valuation:\n\nKeep in mind that all of my calculations are estimates, intended to provide general guidelines for my personal decision-making.\n\n# Multiple Valuation: Price/Sales\n\nDuring the Q4 2024 earnings call, HIMS CEO Andrew Dudum reiterated confidence in the company\u2019s long-term growth trajectory, stating that the goal of reaching 10 million subscribers was well within reach: **\"I think 10 million subs on the platform to me feels really quite in reach. And I think, frankly, pretty straightforward from a growth standpoint if you look at historical growth over the last five to six years. My optimistic hope and personally ambition would be to try to achieve this in the next five to six years.\"**\n\nWith this target in mind, let\u2019s assess a potential share price through the lens of the Price-to-Sales ratio, using Dudum\u2019s stated goal alongside Monthly Average Revenue Per Subscriber (ARPU).\n\nIn Q4 2024, HIMS reported a Monthly ARPU of $73. However, this figure was temporarily elevated by GLP-1 prescriptions. A more balanced estimate comes from the full-year 2024 average, which stood at $63 per subscriber per month. We\u2019ll use this more conservative metric for our valuation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdm1kbwj2oqe1.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3923e95d8bedf34b3836b81ac5250bd6acf01ed\n\n**Bullish/CEO scenario: By 2031, with 10 million subscribers generating $63 in monthly revenue per user:**\n\n***Implied 2031 Price Range:***\u00a0*$102.62 - $205.25.

I first invested after its initial quarter of profitability, starting at $12 and averaging up to $15.89 before Q4 earnings. Prior to Q4 earning, I felt a FV of HIMS was around $57 and was comfortable purchasing below $45. Following the post-earnings dip, I added in the mid-$30s, bringing my cost basis to $27.10.\n\nDespite concerns over GLP-1, I see the reaction as overblown. My long-term conviction remains intact, and I continue to believe in 10x+ potential over the next decade.\n\nCurrently, HIMS is at my target portfolio weighting, but I\u2019d consider adding more if the stock remains in the low-$30s to high-$20s. Based on a 20% margin of safety using a 25% free cash flow growth rate discounted at 10%, I view $46.64 and below as an attractive price. Purchasing in the low-$30s aligns with the more cautious 6 million subscriber scenario.\n\nHIMS isn\u2019t just a GLP-1 stock\u2014it\u2019s a disruptive healthcare brand. The business continues to scale, expand, and differentiate itself, making it a compelling long-term investment opportunity.\n\n# Position:\n\n**Doubling down this week if we remain in mid-30s.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcqmptdn6oqe1.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d82ca9738d9e9e82db87fa6c89a1f2c6fc3027d",

The company could prioritize profitability at any time by reducing marketing spend, but it\u2019s deliberately choosing to optimize for growth.\n\nMore importantly, HIMS is demonstrating\u00a0***marketing leverage***: revenue is growing at a higher rate than marketing spend (See attached image).

The company also has the flexibility to adjust margins as needed\u2014either expanding them or reinvesting in customer acquisition to sustain long-term growth.\n\nFrom the 10-K:\u00a0*\"While marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue due to the timing and discretionary nature of these expenses, with the*\u00a0***additional marketing leverage***\u00a0*driven by our newer offerings, along with the maturation of our existing Subscriber base,*\u00a0***we expect total marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to decrease over the long term.\"***\n\nHIMS is focused on the long term, prioritizing future scale over short-term metrics.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6n22ob7jloqe1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa663628996940ba3c0b01bb2a1a5e61095ddf62",

        "title": "HUYA - 41% Yield - WSB DD!",
        "text": "Time for some good old fashioned DD! \n\nHUYA is the ultimate buy of 2025, let me tell you why. \n\nFirst off, China stocks are soaring, nearly every major institution is going long China. HUYA is best of class, owned by Tencent, the management team is all Tencent, one of the best operators in China and here\u2019s the kicker .. HUYA has NO DEBT and $900 Million in cash, current market cap 750M .. YES, you read that correct they are trading for less than their CASH balance. It makes NO sense, and I believe it will be corrected quickly. \n\nHUYA just announced MAJOR news - they are retuning 50% of their market cap back to investors in COLD HARD CASH. HUYA is paying a $1.47 cent dividend in July. That is a 41% dividend yield ! The stock is currently $3.25 per share. Buying now will give you a cost avg around $1.80 for a Tencent Backed growing company. Very few times in life will you find a 40% yield on your cash, this is one of them. \n\nMore news, they are buying back $100M worth of stock. They bought $1M worth of their own shares in ONE DAY and The CEO made an announcement, \u201cwe feel the stock price does not accurately reflect the business or future of the company.\u201d For those that follow China stocks, BABA made an almost identical statement around $72 per share, now look at BABA (up 100% from that announcement) \n\nNext; PATTERNS \u2026. Last year HUYA announced a large dividend of $1.07 - over the following month the stock climbed the entire amount of the dividend plus much more. People, institutions, etc will pour into this company to lock in that massive 40% divided. I expect the stock to climb at least the amount of dividend plus some before July. \n\nFor every 10,000 shares of HUYA you own, you are making $14,700 in cash payment just this year. In my opinion this stock should return to $6.50 before dividend - meaning 100% gains, plus 40% dividend yield. \n\nHUYA is the best stock in the market at this moment. \n\nPosition: LONG 41,000 shares, with plans to buy much more on any dip.

        "text": "1. **Markets Are Rallying - But Don\u2019t Let That Fool You** Hey! Happy Monday. Yes, stocks are flying higher today. The Dow jumped almost 400 points before the open. And yes, the mood on Wall Street is suddenly\u2026 cheerful. **But don\u2019t get too comfortable.** Because under the surface, nothing has actually changed. The reason for this bounce? Trump. Tariffs. And a little dose of wishful thinking.\n2. **Let\u2019s break down what\u2019s really happening** Over the weekend, *Bloomberg* and *The Wall Street Journal* dropped some reports that lit a fire under the market. Here\u2019s what they said:So now, the narrative is: \u201cMaybe the tariffs won\u2019t be that bad after all.\u201d And just like that, **risk is back on**. **Wall Street\u2019s playing a dangerous game here** Make no mistake - **the tariffs are still coming**. That part hasn\u2019t changed. The only thing that\u2019s shifted is the tone. It\u2019s softer. A bit more \u201cflexible.\u201d But structurally Trump\u2019s whole economic plan is still about dismantling globalization, forcing production back into the U.S., and making imported goods more expensive. That *will* hit supply chains. Especially the ones that depend on semi-finished goods moving back and forth across borders. And that\u2019s what\u2019s making investors uneasy - even as the market rallies.1\n   * Trump\u2019s planned *reciprocal tariffs* \\- which are set to be announced April 2 - may not be as brutal as people feared.\n   * There could be **exceptions for certain countries**.\n   * They may not directly target specific industries like autos, semiconductors, and pharma after all.\n   * And Trump hasn\u2019t reacted to the leaks yet - which is giving investors a strange kind of hope.\n3. **Here\u2019s what\u2019s adding fuel to the fire this week**Put all that together, and you\u2019ve got a technical rally. **But it\u2019s not about confidence in the economy.** It\u2019s just positioning, timing, and a bit of blind optimism. **What about earnings?** It\u2019s a quiet week.Economic data... same story.\n4. So overall, **no major landmines this week**, and that\u2019s helping keep the risk-on mood alive.11\n   1. **Seasonal flows**: Historically, from late March through mid-April, capital flows tend to support U.S. equities. It\u2019s been that way since 1928. Nothing magical - just calendar-based inflows.\n   2. **Pension buying**: Goldman Sachs estimates pension funds will buy around **$29 billion in U.S. stocks** this week as they rebalance at the end of Q1.\n   3. **CTAs (trend-following funds)** are switching: These quant-driven funds were heavily short. Now their models are flipping neutral or bullish - adding more buying pressure across the board.\n   * Tonight: KB Home reports after the close.\n   * Later this week: Dollar Tree, Paychex, Jefferies, Lululemon - a few names, but no heavy hitters.\n   * Nothing that\u2019s likely to shake the market.\n   * Today we got flash PMIs. Manufacturing ticked up a bit (52.7), services slightly weaker (51.2). Nothing shocking.\n   * Friday brings the PCE inflation data - the Fed\u2019s favorite gauge - but expectations are muted.\n5. **Meanwhile, China is making moves too** According to *The Wall Street Journal*, China is considering **export restrictions** aimed at the U.S. That\u2019s a signal: they\u2019re trying to ease tensions, maybe offer a trade olive branch ahead of the April 2 announcements. There\u2019s also talk of a Trump-Xi conversation in April - possibly a symbolic birthday summit (they were born a day apart). That could help dial things down. Or not. **Let\u2019s zoom out for a second** This rally is happening in the middle of a much bigger shift:You couldn\u2019t make this stuff up. Hardliners are pushing for aggressive trade action - and they\u2019ve said openly, **a recession is \u201cworth it\u201d** if it means reshaping the U.S. economy.\n   * **Foreign investors are pulling money out of U.S. stocks.**\n   * The **Dow-to-Gold ratio** is starting to break down - a pattern that tends to show up before major crises.\n   * Corporate earnings **are falling**, even as prices climb. \n   * You couldn\u2019t make this stuff up. Hardliners are pushing for aggressive trade action - and they\u2019ve said openly, **a recession is \u201cworth it\u201d** if it means reshaping the U.S. economy.\n\n1. It\u2019s not strength. It\u2019s a relief bounce.All it takes is one Trump tweet, one policy change, one unexpected reaction from China - and this whole thing could reverse fast. Keep your guard up. **Hope is not a hedge.**\n   * The tariff threat *isn\u2019t gone*, just temporarily softened.\n   * Seasonality and positioning are doing the heavy lifting.\n   * But the deeper risks - falling earnings, policy instability, deglobalization - haven\u2019t gone anywhere.\n\nAll it takes is one Trump tweet, one policy change, one unexpected reaction from China - and this whole thing could reverse fast. Keep your guard up. **Hope is not a hedge.**",

Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.\n\nBy comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.\n\nChinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.\n\nBYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK),\u00a0[BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars.

            "[https://archive.is/69dLB](https://archive.is/69dLB)\n\nA manager of a $3.4 billion Chinese equity fund that\u2019s outperformed virtually all of its peers in 2025 expects a turnaround in consumer confidence will further boost domestic shares.\n\nCashed-up households and Beijing\u2019s pledge to support consumption should propel stocks even higher once sentiment picks up, according to Fidelity International\u2019s Hyomi Jie. Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. and sportswear maker Anta Sports Products Ltd. are among top holdings in her Fidelity Funds - China Consumer Fund, which has beaten 99% of its peers this year with a 16% return.\n\nAnemic consumer spending in the world\u2019s No. 2 economy has been largely driven by weak sentiment, rather than a lack of funds, so \u201cwhen consumer confidence improves, spending will increase and support the overall sentiment toward broader Chinese markets,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the nation\u2019s shares have outpaced most regional peers in 2025 thanks to a DeepSeek-fueled surge in tech stocks, more sectors are starting to participate in the rally. The MSCI China sub-index of consumer discretionary shares is the second-best performing sectoral gauge next to its tech counterpart, jumping about 27% this year.\n\nThe equity market\u2019s gains also coincide with Beijing\u2019s efforts to ramp up consumption. With a volley of subsidies and elevated household savings, more people appear ready to open their wallets. The improving outlook for consumers is already showing up in data, with retail sales growth picking up more than forecast in the first two months of the year.\n\nJie, who\u2019s based in Singapore, is especially bullish on China\u2019s sportswear industry and has been investing in Anta since taking over the portfolio in 2020. The stock is up 11% this year.\n\n\u201cThe sportswear industry in China is one of the largest and fastest growing in the world, driven by the presence of a large millennial population, and increasing focus on healthy lifestyles,\u201d she said. The company is well-positioned to gain from its \u201cstrategy to develop different brands to satisfy different demands\u201d at various price points.\n\nShe also owns shares of Temu parent PDD Holdings Inc. and gaming company NetEase Inc. While the fund has outrun rivals in 2025, it isn\u2019t performing as well on a three- to five-year basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMore than a quarter of her fund\u2019s holdings are artificial intelligence infrastructure names, including Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and Baidu Inc. Jie said they\u2019re key beneficiaries of the recent AI development spurred by DeepSeek\u2019s cost-effective model.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough was born of constraint,\u201d she said. \u201cThe efficiency gains are very significant and will extend across multiple sectors.\u201d",

I don't see a humane way current government regaining back control without going bankrupt. If they do, it will be through terrorizing their own people and hijacking their bank accounts and other assets. If you make money out of this, I will suggest you sell when you see decent profits and buy yourself something nice. Be quick to exit this one.\n\nEDIT: Turkey just BANNED short selling on the Istanbul Stock Exchange for one month.\n\nWhen short selling is banned, you know that BIG TROUBLES are always right around the corner.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nUPDATE: Turkey used a stunning $27BN in reserves to stabilize FX. Given recent reserve losses (USD 27bn), there is already large-scale short-term damage. I would sell TRY fiat for BTC now...",

        "text": "This is a weird post to write because half the people reading it are going to respond with *no fucking shit* but I'm seeing everyone from random WSB shitposters to fancy-pants investment bankers saying we've found the bottom so let's fucking do this.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed's [GDPNow](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow) currently has a -1.8% annualized decline in real GDP for Q1 2025. What does that mean? Well, the [BEA](https://www.bea.gov/help/glossary/recession) will tell you that \"the often-cited identification of a recession with two consecutive quarters of negative\u00a0GDP\u00a0growth is not an official designation\" and \"the designation of a recession is the province of a committee of experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)\"\u2014but that two quarters of negative GDP growth definition is pretty useful in practice. One quarter of economic contraction can be quickly forgotten, but two is generally a sign something is seriously wrong.\n\nA -1.8% annualized decline in one quarter is only like a -0.45% actual decline, but be honest with yourself: does it look like we're fucking done? GDPNow's methodology is similar to the BEA's except that instead of waiting for all the data to come in they update it continuously as new data is released. That does mean the decline could shrink as more data comes in\u2014but it also means the inputs are all stuff that's already actually happened, stuff like \"construction spending\" and \"retail sales\". It doesn't even try to model the effects of leading indicators like [collapsing consumer sentiment](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/university-of-michigan-consumer-sentiment-survey-drops-in-march-to-57point9-worse-than-expected.html), much less predict the future effects of policy changes.\n\nSo let's talk about those policy changes, starting with tariffs, since those have been getting a lot of attention. We seem to be at the stage where people who want to believe everything's going to be OK are combing through Trump's statements for whatever scraps of reassurance they can find, which they can do because of Trump's tendency to speak in word-salad and promise everything to everyone.\n\nFor example, here's an [answer](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/21/trump-says-therell-be-flexibility-on-reciprocal-tariffs.html) he gave  on Friday to a question in an Oval Office press conference (transcription mine):\n\n>People are coming to me and talking about tariffs and a lot of people are asking me if they can have exceptions, and once you do that for one you have to do that for all, so I mean generally, I did something interestingly during two weeks ago, I gave the American car companies a break because it would've been unfair if I didn't and everybody said \"oh he changed his mind on tariffs!\" I didn't change my mind I helped our, you know, sort of big three, big four, I helped some of the American companies and instead of taking it properly they said \"oh he changed his\u2014\" I don't change, but the world \"flexibility\"'s an important word, sometimes there's flexibility, so there'll be flexibility, but basically it's reciprocal so that if China's charging us 50% or 30% or 20%, and I don't mean China I mean anybody, any country, Canada, nobody knows that Canada's charging our dairy farmers, they have 270% tariffs, nobody knows that, nobody knows that, they have up to 400%, they have a couple of tariffs, at 400%, nobody knows that, nobody talks about that.\n\nHe then went off on an extended tangent about why Canada should be a US state before ending by reiterating that \"nobody knows that they were getting 270% tariffs on dairy products\". And people have, in apparent seriousness, cited this answer as a reason for optimism, because he said there will be flexibility! Beyond the obvious rebuttals, it should be noted that the example he gave of \"flexibility\" was a [one-month pause](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-lutnick-2b269614084027a4894aa14f3dc16227), meaning tariffs are still coming for U.S. automakers.\n\nThe economic effects of mass-firings, along with cancelling leases and other contracts, don't get discussed as much. But they'll likely be quite serious. Mass-firings of federal workers could have an apocalyptic effect on the economies of Virginia and Maryland, effects by no means limits to the public sector, because those public sector employees are going to have to cut their spending at countless private businesses. Similarly, cancellation of leases threatens to crash real estate markets.\n\nAnd while the many of the effects may be concentrated in the DC metro area, there are major government offices spread throughout the country, so the mass-firings and lease cancellations will create little pockets of economic pain everywhere. Some effects may even be concentrated in rural areas\u2014like the effects of [cancelling contracts to buy food from American farmers to distribute as food aid](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5311663/farmers-will-be-hit-hard-by-the-dismantling-of-usaid).\n\nThen there's the fact that many of the fired federal workers were actually doing stuff that's really important for the US economy to functions. Firing FAA workers threatens to hurt airlines and domestic tourism. Firing people at the CDC makes it harder to fight bird flu, which is bad not just for the egg industry but also beef and dairy. And so on.\n\nFinally there's Trump's immigration policies, whose effects range from farm workers being afraid to show up for work to completely fucking international tourism because apparently multi-week detentions of random tourists from [Europe](https://apnews.com/article/border-tourists-german-canadian-detention-immigration-408cd27338e8065268fabc835f8b0c34) and [Canada](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/canadian-detained-us-immigration-jasmine-mooney) is a thing we're doing now. Recently there was a forecast of a [5% decline in international tourism](https://fortune.com/2025/03/17/foreign-tourism-us-forecast-trump-tariffs-trade-war-russia-ukraine-war/) which under the circumstances actually strikes me as optimistic.\n\nI suspect the main reason a lot of people resist seeing what's staring them in the face is that during Trump's first administration the economy did okay until COVID hit. \"Util COVID hit\" is a pretty big caveat, especially with RFK Jr. running HHS, but never mind that. The bigger issue is that during his first term, there were still people in both the Republican congressional caucuses and his own administration willing to tell Trump \"no\". We don't seem to have that anymore, unless you count X \u00c6 A-12 telling him to \"shush\".\n\nSo TLDR; all signs point to us already having experienced an economic contraction in Q1 2025, and there's every reason to expect it to continue into Q2 and beyond. A recession, in other words. Of course, the question we all want to know on WallStreetBets is what this means for the stock market.\n\nFaithful believers in the efficient market hypothesis will insist everything I've described and more is already \"priced in\", to which I say: LOL. So far the S&P 500 has fallen 10% peak to trough, but a 10% drop is a fucking sneeze by stock market standards. I remember back in 2015 when my boss told me he was selling all his stocks because of some bullshit with China. I *didn't* sell because I didn't want to be the guy who sold at the bottom, but by the time the 2015-2016 selloff was over the S&P 500 was down 14%\u2014over fucking *nothing*.\n\nAn actual recession probably means a much more severe decline in stock prices. If I believed Trump administration messaging about [\"temporary pain\"](https://gazette.com/news/wex/trump-officials-acknowledge-temporary-pain-amid-tariffs-and-market-unease/article_0186aba5-768e-572d-be2f-e9f2ef31ecbf.html), the precedent I'd be looking at is Paul Volker more or less causing a recession on purpose to fight inflation, which involved a 27% decline in the S&P 500. But Trump and Musk aren't Paul fucking Volker, so I'm expecting a greater than 30% decline.\n\nHow much more than 30%? Beats me, but assuming a decline of 31.5% decline from SPY's $612.93 peak yields a nice, easy-to-remember target price of $420. It could easily go even lower, but will almost certainly bounce back, and a lot of people aren't going to want to miss the recovery. Therefore, I wouldn't feel too stupid going long SPY at $420. At its current price, though, count me out.\n\nSo what do you do about it? Full-porting SPY 12/31 430p is obviously insanely risky. And unfortunately, given the range of tail-risks we're facing\u2014the debt ceiling, Trump deciding to actually act on [previous comments that much US government debt might be fraudulent](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud), or even fucking with the banking system\u2014I don't think any position is entirely safe. That said, here's what I've currently got.  \"Other\" stocks is GLD, domestic bonds are overwhelmingly TIPS:",

        "title": "Is the sell off of overvalued stocks to retail the savior of our economy?",
        "text": "So I have been thinking. What if the selling of all overvalued stocks and basically shit to retail the smartes move for Big Institutions? 2008 happened because institutions tried to sell each other the hot potato quickly devaluating everything until one got stuck with a huge pile of shit and had to go bankrupt and the rest had to be saved by the government and its taxpayers.\n\nWhat if they learned from it (smth very unlike but there is a small chance they did) and decided the best way to go is to animate the retailers to buy a big chunk of that shit so that on their books they only hold a small part of it and the loses are mainly eaten up by retail?\n\nI know this sounds weird because either way retail gets fucked but in this option no institution has to go bankrupt or have to receive hate from general population since they can simply say: hey guys you decided to invest in smth that is highly speculative you lost it on your own, but look at us since we are pros at this we didn\u2019t loose as much. \nUnlike if they would loose it it would be more of a: hey guys we tried reaching for the sun and got burned in the process. \n\nWhich in turn would explain the massive push for alternative trading platforms such as Robinhood and other online retail options. It\u2019s just a hedge of huge institutions to make sure that when shit hits the fan they aren\u2019t the ones holding it. ",

            "> Klarna defended its business model in a blog post, saying because it does not charge interest, it relies on customers paying on time, as opposed to credit cards. Those who miss payments are cut off from deferring more, a practice that leaves 99% of its lending repaid, it said. Its average user owes the company $100.\n\nI have a feeling the average loan owed to Klarna will increase once this becomes active on DoorDash.  Also they are just saying that as long as you make a payment on time you can continue deferring more without necessarily stating what the max amount allowable would be.",

This industry is propped up by nearly 2/3rds subprime (read: shit) borrowers with a significantly higher rate of loan stacking compared to the average creditor, who are using it because they usually can't even get credit cards.\n\nAnd at least before it was just for shit like couches off Amazon or a new PS5.

They are seeking legal recourse.\n\n**OP's Confusion (In a Nutshell):**  If there were no shares to be assigned, why was OP debited $150?  Robinhood's explanation is that this is how cash settlement works in these situations, but the OP disagrees.\n\n**Robinhood's response:** The options were cash settled due to delisting and the OCC memo supports their process.  There were no shares to assign, hence the $0 value at settlement.\n\n**Additional Notes:**  This involves a highly technical aspect of options trading and delisting procedures.  The user seems to fundamentally misunderstand how cash settlement of options contracts works when the underlying asset ceases trading before expiration.  Consulting with a securities lawyer specializing in options and OCC regulations is recommended for OP.",

Finally, I averaged the results to find the price target for SoFi.\n\n**Is this a methodologically correct method of financial modeling? No**, but I believe that this is a way to keep in mind the time value of money when evaluating P/E ratio ahead of today's earnings period.\n\n**My conclusion is that SoFi is underpriced and has a decent upside ahead.** Please be mindful that the model's assumptions are not grounded on a scientific basis. Therefore, changes in assumptions could result in a drastically different conclusion.\n\nLastly, I understand that the extension of forecasted periods would ultimately result in the target price in future periods converging to zero as the discount factor increases exponentially, so the result I have is also highly dependent on how many forecast periods to include. For good measure, I decided to extend for 5 more years after the member growth is expected to stabilize at 3%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ric9wsm6z9qe1.png?width=1734&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b6250e92d523fb7bca5f12349ea4d8d716f9036\n\n",

Cost me about $85k when I couldn't sell at the top. Still escaped with $103k profit.\n\nThought I was gonna start working at Wendy's, but the last 10 minutes changed everything.\nSeriously though, that last 15 mins of trading was pure insanity - never doing that again. Like a Boomer, I'm going to invest these gains in IXUS and XEQT instead of trying my luck next week.\n\nShoutout to PumpkinWest7430, gave some guidance and tried to keep me sane but my degeneracy couldn't help it.\n",

            "Auto liquidation by broker since it was deep in the money. Looks like Etrade, next time call them and tell them to not auto liquidate and they won\u2019t do this. But you have to call in each time you have options ITM or close to ITM on expiry day. \n\nMost brokers have an auto liquidation process if you don\u2019t have the necessary $$$ to sustain an options exercise.",
            "Yup, if you're sitting on profitable options that are about to expire worthless  within the next approximately 90mins or less, and your account doesn't have the resources needed to exercise,the brokerage doesn't usually just let it go up in smoke. They'll close for you. This is especially true if the position is using some of their margin.\n\nThis is `**NOT**` guaranteed behavior though so people should not just assume this will always happen on all brokerages. Probably depends on the net worth of the entire account.\n\ne.g., I buy some 0DTE on Gamestop and go to work, it's announced that GME is now America's official online-download-for-games for ALL consoles in USA. GME goes to the moon and the options are worth 800% of my entire portfolio, E-Trade would probably phone call me. If I don't pick up, they'll definitely sell-to-close for me. But that's 'cuz Etrade and that's because they can see the position is worth multiples of my entire port so they can assume I'd be pretty upset to find out later the options expired - even though it's my own fault.\n\nEtrade stands to gain as well 'cuz when you're pleasantly surprised by a very profitable transaction made on your behalf, you're more likely to leave those funds in your Etrade account - and they definitely like having more customers with large balances :)",

        "text": "WASHINGTON/DUBAI (Reuters) -The United Arab Emirates has committed to a 10-year, $1.4 trillion investment framework in the United States after top UAE officials met President Donald Trump this week, the White House said on Friday.\n\nThe framework will \"substantially increase the UAE's existing investments in the U.S. economy\" in AI infrastructure, semiconductors, energy, and manufacturing, the White House said in a statement.\n\nThe White House did not outline how UAE investments would reach $1.4 trillion, with some of the deals unveiled as part of the framework having already been announced.\n\nThe only fully new deal appeared to be an investment by Emirates Global Aluminium in what would be the first new aluminum smelter in the United States in 35 years, the White House said, adding the plant \"would nearly double U.S. domestic aluminum production\".\n\n\"Developing a primary aluminium smelter in the U.S. has been part of EGA's ambitions for several years,\" a spokesperson for the firm said in a statement.\n\nThe UAE, an oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S., is looking to deepen investment ties with Washington and is emerging as a global leader in AI, one of the sectors it is betting on to diversify its economy away from energy.\n\nIn September, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan met former U.S. President Joe Biden, in the first visit of a UAE president to the White House, as the two leaders discussed deepening cooperation in areas such as AI, investments and space exploration.\n\nGulf sovereign wealth funds, including Abu Dhabi's $330-billion Mubadala, are already big U.S. investors, and Trump and his family have business ties to the region.\n\nOVAL OFFICE MEETING\n\nTrump in January asked Saudi Arabia to spend upwards of $1 trillion in the U.S. economy, over four years, including purchases of military equipment, and said this month he likely would make his first trip abroad to the Gulf country to seal an investment agreement.\n\nThe deal, which could happen between this month or the next, would come at a time when Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's biggest economy, has been taking a more prominent role in U.S. foreign policy. The Gulf country is set to host diplomatic talks around Ukraine involving the United States and Russia next week.\n\nThe White House said on Friday the UAE agreement resulted from a meeting that Trump held on Tuesday with national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan in the Oval Office and a dinner that Vice President JD Vance and several cabinet members held with the UAE delegation, which included the heads of major UAE sovereign wealth funds and corporations.\n\nAmong the tie-ups highlighted on Friday was a partnership between UAE sovereign wealth fund ADQ, which is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon, and U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners, for a $25 billion U.S.-focused initiative to invest in energy infrastructure and data centers. That had been previously announced two days ago.\n\nA commitment by XRG, the international investment arm of UAE state oil company ADNOC launched in November, to support U.S. natural gas production and exports with an investment in the NextDecade liquefied natural gas export facility in Texas, had previously been made public last year by ADNOC, under Biden.",

        "text": "This is my first dd post and it\u2019s mostly a look at  the technical chart with some flavorings of qualitative analysis driving this on the back end. No chatgpt and I am highly regarded. \n\n**First point: reverse head and shoulders**\n\nA. initial low post ipo slide @$11.68\n\nB. one higher low in late 2023 @$15.12\n\nC. ATL early 2024 @$8.26\n\nD. Higher low late 2024 @$9.50\n\nIn these 4 points(circled in graph), is developing, somewhat of a reverse head and shoulders pattern, I believe there might be opportunity for breakout, especially after the recent market wide selloff driving higher risk stocks like RIVN down sharply. Confirmation would be around $15-16 and I believe this could bring it to the $20-35 range\n\n**Second point: Descending triangle Sellers meeting buyers floor**\n\nAs seen in the chart, there is a clear series of lower highs(blue downward sloping line), and support from buyers around $11. The price has been flirting with the upward trend line, and I believe there are two scenarios. \n\n1. The stocks goes sharply lower, driven by broader market forces, marking it\u2019s capitulation and goes sharply higher from abysmal lows. \n\n2. Market trades sideways or upwards and RIVN starts an upward trend more gradually\n\nEither way, I see an opportunity in trading this stock. With it losing $5.3B last year, I can\u2019t convince myself to invest in it as a long term value play (my normal investments), but I can see it as an acquisition target from a bigger auto player or PE (private equity) fund who wants to get skin in the EV game, either of these two giving an insane valuation justification for short term trading. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be so confident in this if it weren\u2019t for the, I guess I\u2019ll call it, among other things.. \u201cEV biased administration\u201d and it\u2019s partnership with players like Amazon and VW. \n\nI\u2019m a buyer in the $7.75 - $9.50 range. Might buy some today just to get some skin in the game as I don\u2019t hate it at $11.35, just don\u2019t love it. \n\nAlso, I think it\u2019s important to note, I\u2019m cautionary with options on this play, especially deep OTM Calls that will be worthless if an acquisition price is less than strike after a 30-40% pop from rumors of M&A (merger and acquisition). \n\nDisclaimer: This is not advice and consult a financial professional before trading. \n\n\n",

        "text": "(Reuters) -FedEx's shares fell 11% on Friday after the parcel delivery firm cut its annual forecasts, fanning worries about the health of U.S. manufacturing amid uncertainty from the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs on trading partners.\n\nCEO Raj Subramaniam warned a day earlier that the company was navigating a very \"challenging operating environment\" and \"weakness in the industrial economy\" was weighing on its higher-margin business-to-business volumes.\n\nThe company's shares hit their lowest in nearly two years on Friday. FedEx and rival UPS are viewed as barometers for the global economy due to their involvement across a swathe of industries.\n\nShipments from companies that produce goods used in manufacturing drive substantial cargo volumes and high-margin deliveries for the delivery firms.\n\nUPS' shares were down 3%, while European peer DHL fell 2.2%.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's on-and-off import tariffs have created uncertainty for businesses, prompting them to be more cautious with their spending in an uncertain economic landscape.\n\nAnalysts have said Trump's levies could trigger a recession and a trade war, further hammering demand for transportation and delivery services.\n\n\"FedEx's Q3 print and full-year forecast cut will likely exacerbate concerns of structural pressures in the parcel business,\" Morgan Stanley said, adding that it may even overwhelm the company's cost-cutting program.\n\nFedEx has been reducing costs as demand for lower-margin e-commerce deliveries from companies such as Temu and Shein outpaces higher-margin business-to-business shipments.\n\n\"Management noted weakness in the industrial economy and, while macro is a factor, we believe structural forces are a far bigger headwind than the market thinks,\" Morgan Stanley added.\n\nThe company lowered its fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per share forecast to between $18.00 and $18.60, from $19 to $20 previously.\n\nThe forecast cut itself was far from a surprise, but the magnitude, particularly for one remaining quarter, was greater than feared, Evercore ISI said.\n\nAt least 10 brokerages cut their price targets on the company's stock on Friday.",

            "Trying to impose tariffs on the rest of the world is a really dumb idea, but it is especially dumb doing it to China.  The US is more dependent on them than they are on the US.

            "this is already happening, and everyone will be impacted. china's margins will go down since the us has the highest margin, everywhere else will either tariff china or lose their jobs, and eventually china will be forced to stop subsidizing unlimited production which is the us goal. \n\ntarrifs to offset subsidies are one of the few good uses for them, the nation with unfair subsidies is stuck with the debt of subsidizing production but doesn't get the gains of eating others markets in the long term.",
            "The US is the biggest consumer market on the planet and China\u2019s biggest customer by far. They won\u2019t be able to simply shift sales elsewhere to make up for lower sales to the US. \n\nI also don\u2019t know how much margin they have to just lower prices to compensate for tariffs either since they\u2019re already operating at sweat shop levels in their factories anyway. \n\nThe upside for the US is a lot of the cheap stuff we buy from them aren\u2019t necessities, so US consumers aren\u2019t forced to buy it if prices go up. Prices going up also adds competition for Chinese goods from manufacturers here and elsewhere. \n\nI\u2019d expect china to be motivated to make a trade deal to resume the flow as their economy has been shaky for a while and they can\u2019t afford to have a bunch of their factories go idle and the resulting job losses."

Their global presence is an advantage here, since the issue with getting FDA approval for drugs from China is that their clinical trials only tend test on chinese subjects, the FDA has stricter requirements for trial diversity. If AZ can bring the trials to western countries, they can bring the drugs to market faster too.\n\nAs for the tax probe thing, its like a $5M fine\ud83d\udc80.

        "text": "Germany\u2019s mammoth spending package cleared its last parliamentary hurdle, paving the way for as much as \u20ac1 trillion in civilian and defense investments to jolt the region\u2019s economy and reduce its military reliance on the U.S.\n\nBut economists and defense experts have warned that for Germany and Europe to reap the full benefits, the wall of money would need to be flanked with ambitious\u2014and not necessarily popular\u2014structural overhauls, including tax, bureaucracy and labor-market reforms.\n\nGermany\u2019s spending plan, equivalent to around $1.08 trillion, has drawn cheers across a continent unnerved by signs that the U.S. is downgrading its security commitment to Europe and seeking a rapprochement with President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, which is seen as the region\u2019s biggest threat.\n\n\u201cBerlin is breaking the piggy bank, and it\u2019s doing it even before the next government is in office,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a Paris-based expert on strategy and defense who has advised the French president. \u201cGermany is giving itself the means to become a military force to match its economic and strategic weight. That\u2019s a sea change.\u201d\n\nFriedrich Merz, winner of last month\u2019s German election and the man in line to become chancellor, has pledged to focus on European cooperation after the departing government became increasingly distracted by internal frictions between the coalition\u2019s three parties.\n\nThe German spending plan he developed marks a U-turn for Berlin, which for years preached fiscal discipline to its European neighbors while letting its military atrophy for lack of investment. The package\u2019s scale dwarfs a \u20ac158 billion defense fund floated by the European Commission this month to support military spending in the European Union and fund future help for Ukraine.\u00a0\n\nThe German decision is especially credible, Heisbourg said, because it would directly benefit German arms manufacturers, including Rheinmetall, an armored-vehicle and ammunition manufacturer, and others that have proven their ability to deliver large orders quickly on behalf of Ukraine.\u00a0\n\nThe spending package is made possible by a constitutional amendment that effectively exempts defense-related spending from the provisions of Germany\u2019s strict fiscal rules, which ban budget deficits bigger than 0.35% of gross domestic product. This exemption will apply not just to spending on military hardware but also on cybersecurity, intelligence and civil protection.\u00a0\n\nBecause Germany has relatively low public debt, the upshot is that it will from now on be able to spend as much on defense as investors are willing to lend it\u2014at least and as long as overall spending doesn\u2019t breach the EU\u2019s more lenient spending rules.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe priority now is to make sure that the money is being spent efficiently and not only to plug gaps in hardware,\u201d said Ben Schreer, executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies\u2019 Europe office in Berlin. \u201cNow we have the possibility to think about the capacities that we need to build\u2014in software, in artificial intelligence, in communications, in space\u2014if we\u2019re going to become less dependent on the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe amendment also creates a \u20ac500 billion investment fund to be spent on the country\u2019s long-neglected transport, communication, digital and power infrastructure as well as on measures to combat climate change, over the next 12 years.\n\nThe legislation was designed so that only new investment is eligible for funding\u2014a provision meant to prevent existing investments from migrating from the ordinary budget into the fund.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAfter the amendment gathered the necessary two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament on Tuesday and Friday, the package\u2019s implementation will depend on detailed legislation that will be drafted when the next government takes office.\n\nThis is likely to happen at the end of April as Merz\u2019s conservatives and their prospective center-left coalition partners are still locked in negotiations over the government\u2019s policy agenda for the next four years. While the two buried their differences to push the spending package through, they remain at odds on issues ranging from how much should be done to combat illegal immigration to the merits of cutting income and corporate tax.\n\nThe spending package has caused some consternation in conservative ranks after Merz campaigned against relaxing the country\u2019s fiscal rules. But most economists agree that the combination of rapid rearmament and much-needed infrastructure investments could be a boon for an economy that has barely grown since before the Covid-19 pandemic and has been in recession for the past two years.\n\nThe plan could help Germany\u2019s GDP grow by 0.3% this year and 2.1% by 2027 if it is implemented quickly, according to insurer Allianz. While Germany\u2019s public debt was set to fall rapidly on the previous spending trajectory, it could now reach 68% of GDP by 2027, Allianz said\u2014still low by European and U.S. standards and likely without a sizable impact on the country\u2019s funding costs.\u00a0\n\nBut the group\u2019s economists also warned that unlocking and maintaining this level of growth over time without rekindling inflation would require Germany to implement a number of structural overhauls, including fixing its unsustainable pension system, increasing incentives to work and innovate, and cutting taxes, not all of which would be popular with voters.\n\nLikewise, the economic fallout from the extra military spending would be biggest if Germany ensures most of the money is spent at home and in Europe and a substantial share of it goes to research and development, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. This would increase the likelihood that military innovations find their way into the private sector, thus boosting growth further.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe planned defense spending can give Germany a structural boost if it is spent correctly,\u201d said Moritz Schularick, the institute\u2019s president.\n\nAnalysts said the next government would also need to fix slow, bureaucratic and inefficient procurement processes at the Defense Ministry to ensure that the extra money borrowed on capital markets can actually be absorbed by the military.\u00a0\n",

        "text": "With the first quarter of 2025 showing notable financial turbulence, one of the key drivers seems to be U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to re-impose tariffs. This move has caused a sharp drop in the S&P 500 as investors rapidly divest from U.S. equities, sparking a shift towards European and Chinese markets.\n\nOn top of that, emerging economies like Turkey, Indonesia, and Colombia are also feeling the pressure due to their own domestic political issues. With so much volatility, do you think this will lead to long-term instability in the global markets, or could this be a short-term reaction?\n\nHow should investors be responding to these market shifts? Are there any strategies you would recommend for navigating this financial uncertainty?\n\nLet\u2019s discuss!",

            "The market reaction isn\u00b4t the problem. The problem is, that the market reaction predicts a downturn of the economy. And when the economy slows and starts contracting, the makets will follow downward again. One more problem with a recession is, that many are only recognised after they already happened. And since the Fed wants to see hard facts, before they intervene, it means, they will only act on a recession, once we\u00b4re at least way in it.\n\nTo be fair, it kind of makes sense. The recession would be easily avoidable, if the trade war was called off. So it\u00b4s not really the job of the Fed, to steer against it, when the captain orders full speed ahead.\n\nAnd I said this before: F... the markets. The real life impact on ordinary americans is, what makes this gutwrenching. Our portfolios can just turn into sleeping beauties and wake like Cthulhu, once it is over.\n\nAs for a strategy, I think I read somewhere, the Hedge Funds have started to just move to the sidelines and sit it out. Which makes sense. A lot of retail investors entered the market on the bull run. That made price finding less efficient. The volatility right now will squeeze a lot of them out. Usually after that the market should calm. There is a big if, though, as long as the macroeconomic outlook can turn around at 3 am because of the taste of a Hamburger.\n\nIf there is a prolongued trade war, trade and supply chains will rearrange around the US. It\u00b4s what the market just does. We\u00b4ve already seen canadian oil, headed to the US being redirected to Europe. And all of that will experience trial and error phases.\n\nAs to the global consequences: We are seeing right now reverberations from past years in Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. That\u00b4s all still ripple effects from Covid and the invasion of Ukraine. What a trade war and the killing off of US stabilization efforts will cause is absolutely unpredictable.",

Then there\u2019s the possibility of Dems winning back some seats in two years, which can really neutralize things. So if you\u2019re holding shares for a longer outlook you should be fine. \n\nIf you\u2019re talking about options, differently story. Market is probably going to look a lot like 2022 when shit traded sideways. There will be opportunities with volatility."

        "title": "FedEx cuts full-year results forecast on \u2018uncertainty\u2019 in economy, bad weather",
        "text": "(Reuters) -FedEx Corp lowered its full-year profit and revenue forecasts on Thursday, as the parcel delivery firm battles stubbornly soft demand and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy as President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on trading partners.\n\n\"Our revised earnings outlook reflects continued weakness and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy, which is constraining demand for our business-to-business services,\" Chief Financial Officer John Dietrich said in a statement.\n\nFedEx shares were down 5.5% to $232.69 in after-hours trade, while rival United Parcel Service stock fell less than 1%. Those companies are seen as barometers for the global economy since their business touches so many types of businesses.\n\nBoth companies have been slashing costs as less lucrative e-commerce delivery demand outperforms that of higher-margin shipments between businesses.\n\nThe industrial sector includes firms that produce products used to make other goods. It drives significant cargo volume and more profitable deliveries for FedEx and UPS. Many executives in the U.S. transportation industry had been banking on the industrial economy returning to growth this year.\n\nThose hopes appear to have been dented by new and threatened tariffs from the Trump administration. Experts are also concerned those import levies could spark a trade war that further weakens transportation and delivery demand.\n\nMemphis-based FedEx on Thursday lowered its full-year forecast for adjusted profit to $18 to $18.60 per share. FedEx in December cut that profit forecast for the fiscal year ending May 2025 to $19 to $20 per share, down from its initial target range of $20 to $22 per share.\n\nFedEx also expects revenue for the 12 months ending in May to be flat to slightly down year-on-year, versus its earlier forecast for it to be approximately flat.\n\nFor the third quarter that ended on February 28, FedEx reported adjusted profit per share of $4.51. that was up from $3.86 per share last year, but below average analyst estimates of $4.54, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nFedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam said the results came as the company was \"navigating a very challenging operating environment, including a compressed peak season and severe weather events.\"\n\nFedEx and UPS are locked in a fierce battle for market share, which analysts worry could lead to a price war.\n\nFedEx and the United States Postal Service, its largest customer, ended their air cargo contract in September. UPS picked up that business, but in January said it was accelerating a plan to slash deliveries for its largest customer, Amazon.com.\n\nFedEx in December announced long-awaited plans to spin off its profitable Freight division, a move analysts said could unlock up to $20 billion in shareholder value while clearing the way for FedEx management to focus on merging operations of its separate Express and Ground units to boost profits.\n\nFedEx executives said on Thursday that the company remained on track for permanent cost reductions of $2.2 billion for fiscal 2025.",

        "text": "I\u2019ll share a screenshot of my positions in a thread below, so if that\u2019s all you\u2019re here for go ahead and look.\n\nMy fellow regards, I believe it\u2019s time to call bullshit on this market. Please understand, I don\u2019t care who you voted for\u2026 I guarantee I like you a hell of a lot more than I like the banks, and that is exactly who the winner is going to be unless people wake up to the reality of our situation quickly. \n\nBefore touching any kind of political news, let\u2019s start with market indicators. \n\nBofA\u2019s recent mm survey showed that most MM\u2019s are reducing their share of US equities (source 1 below), there are other signs the banks are getting out as well (check my second to last post), BlackRock is struggling to find buyers. \n\nAt the same time, a record number of American households now own stock in US equities (source 2 below). Now, from what I know about American households (I live in one), most of us live paycheck to paycheck\u2026 we don\u2019t really have money to put into stocks willy-nilly.\n\n\nSo what does all of this mean? \n\nWell, my thesis is that the average American has their rent/mortgage in US equities tied up in stocks like Tesla right now as an act of patriotism\u2026 what saddens me most is that I appreciate this general sentiment (not for Tesla necessarily, but I do actually love my country despite what the news may tell you), but the banks are taking advantage of it. So what happens when all the sudden everyone has to pay their bills? \n\nThat\u2019s right\u2026 another mass sell off. \n\nPlease believe me when I say that I hope I\u2019m wrong, this is not going to be good for average, working people with, at the very least, good-hearted intentions\u2026 but I don\u2019t see any signs to indicate that I am.\n\nNow we\u2019ll touch a bit on economic outlook and history:\n\nWe are currently still in a battle with inflation, JPow said it yesterday, even before tariffs we were looking at 2 more years before we return to normal and the outlook with tariffs puts it all on pause. He hedged to say \u2018they aren\u2019t sure how tariffs will affect inflation\u2019, let me fill in the gap there: either tariffs will affect inflation (because the costs are passed on to consumers) or they will affect earnings (because companies absorb them)\u2026 the money has to come from somewhere. If it affects inflation, the fed will be forced to raise interest rates or at the very least pause on cuts indefinitely. If it doesn\u2019t affect inflation, it will affect earnings/growth\u2026 if this sounds familiar, then you may have heard of stagflation. And if you study the history of the federal reserve, you may know what the solution to that problem is\u2026 Volcker\u2019s hammer. You can look it up yourself but the gist is that in the late 70\u2019s we had been battling inflation and stagnant growth for years, until Paul Volcker was appointed to head the federal reserve and raised interest rates to 20%\u2026 it absolutely crushed the economy, sent us to the stone ages\u2026 but it did reset our inflation and led us into a very booming 80\u2019s. \n\nI want to reiterate\u2026 I don\u2019t like either side politically, they\u2019re all in bed with the banks. The only reason I\u2019m posting this is because I\u2019m angry at the thought of them getting super leveraged on overpriced stocks and then dumping it on average people. This has so many shades of 2008 it\u2019s not funny. Feel free to argue, bet against me, whatever\u2026 I genuinely don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve been a value investor since I was 14 and I\u2019m currently 28. I held through 2020 and 2022, this time feels much much different. \n\nWhatever you decide to do with this information, be safe out there.\n\nSources:\n1. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/bofa-survey-shows-biggest-ever-drop-in-exposure-to-us-equities\n2. https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/20/us-households-are-more-invested-in-stocks-than-ever-and-its-distorting-market-valuation-says-jpmorgan.html",

        "title": "Nvidia CEO Says He Was Surprised That Publicly Held Quantum Firms Exist",
        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he didn\u2019t realize there were publicly traded quantum-computing companies when he made earlier comments that caused industry stocks to crash.\n\n\u201cMy first reaction was, I didn\u2019t know they were public. How can a quantum company be public?\u201d Huang said at an event Thursday focused on the still-nascent technology.\n\nThe executive had said in January that \u201cvery useful\u201d quantum computers are probably decades away, causing shares of IonQ Inc. and other companies to tumble. Thursday\u2019s event \u2014 part of Nvidia\u2019s weeklong GTC conference \u2014 invited some of those very companies on stage to discuss their prospects with Huang.\n\nThe quantum-computing industry aims to use the unique properties of subatomic particles to process data much faster than traditional semiconductor-based electronics. The technical difficulties of building practical systems have meant that the field is still in an experimental stage. In addition to quantum upstarts, companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google are also trying find practical uses for quantum systems.\n\nThe companies on stage at Thursday\u2019s event included IonQ and D-Wave Quantum Inc. Huang said it was natural for this new form of computing to take many years to develop since it was so novel. The companies might be able to convince him that quantum computing is happening more quickly than he expected, he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know,\u201d he joked.\n\n\u201cThis whole session is going to be like a therapy session for me,\u201d he said.\n\nThe six company leaders on stage gave him a variety of answers. Some argued that quantum computers are already in use to solve difficult science problems. Others posited that the technology is even closer to helping advance traditional computing.\n\nExecutives also said it wasn\u2019t unreasonable to spend a decade honing a technology that will have such a large impact. Loic Henriet, who runs the French company Pasqal, argued that the term \u201cquantum computing\u201d was misleading. Quantum processors will help act as accelerators \u2014 working alongside traditional computers \u2014 rather than replacing them, he said.\n\n  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ceo-says-surprised-publicly-180729079.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ceo-says-surprised-publicly-180729079.html)",

        "title": "Lyft to Offer Driverless Ride-Hails \u2018as Soon as This Summer\u2019",
        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Lyft Inc. said it plans to offer driverless vehicles on its platform \u201cas soon as this summer,\u201d and that it sees human drivers transitioning to other work such as fleet management as autonomous rides become more ubiquitous.\n\nThe company has been spending more time pitching its vision for the future of its gig-economy business model as it plays catch-up in offering autonomous rides. Driverless ride-hailing has become more commonplace in some key US markets through competing platforms. Like rival Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft envisions a hybrid future where human drivers will complement autonomous vehicle fleets, especially during periods of peak demand.\n\nThe autonomous-vehicle economy will create new jobs such as remote vehicle support, fleet management, and map data labeling and validation, said Jeremy Bird, Lyft\u2019s executive vice president in charge of driver experience, said Thursday in a blog post. He also confirmed the driverless service could begin as early as this summer. The company had previously committed to a launch sometime in 2025.\n\nBird also said the idea of drivers eventually owning autonomous vehicles is core to the company\u2019s strategy, and this will become more feasible as the cost falls for those cars. That would enable drivers to operate small fleets, not unlike how some Airbnb Inc. hosts have made a business out of renting out multiple properties. Elon Musk has a similar vision in which Tesla owners would monetize their vehicles when they aren\u2019t personally using them.\n\n\u201cEven when technology encroaches on human jobs, it doesn\u2019t eliminate the need for humans altogether \u2014 especially when workers can provide value that the machines cannot,\u201d Bird wrote. \u201cHumans are features, not bugs, and we\u2019ll continue to find a way to reward those that provide great service as part of a thriving hybrid network.\u201d\n\nLyft and Uber currently rely on millions of drivers to quickly match with riders. But Lyft, which only operates in the US and Canada, is more exposed to increasing competition from domestic autonomous ride providers such as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo.\n\nWaymo began offering driverless service more broadly in major markets like San Francisco and Los Angeles last year, and has partnered exclusively with Uber to offer those rides in Austin starting this month. The two companies have a similar agreement to launch driverless trips in Atlanta this summer.\n\nWhen Lyft launches its first driverless trips, it will be through existing partnerships, including with Toyota Motor Corp.-backed startup May Mobility in Atlanta.\n\nLyft shares have declined 9% since the start of the year, while Uber\u2019s have gained 23% so far.\n\nUber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi has gone so far as to predict that human drivers will eventually be displaced as autonomous software develops superior driving skills over the next 15 to 20 years. The company has made some early efforts to help create new earnings opportunities for its network of gig workers, including piloting a Taskrabbit-like service where customers can hire people to complete various household tasks. It\u2019s also recruiting coders and language experts to fuel its new AI data labeling business.\n\nIn his blog post, Lyft\u2019s Bird stopped short of predicting when drivers might be displaced, instead saying that driverless cars will create new opportunities for drivers. That includes manual work required to service, maintain and charge the vehicles. These are \u201cjobs for which drivers are well suited,\u201d Bird added.\n\nThe industry will also need customer service workers to respond to unusual events during driverless rides. In Lyft\u2019s case, 30% of the staff working in its fleet management unit Flexdrive are former or current Lyft drivers, Bird wrote.\n\nThe company has also proposed ways for drivers to find jobs in other industries, offering free training to enter the tech industry. CEO David Risher also recently announced a new feature that uses AI to generate a recommendation letter, which active drivers in good standing can share with potential employers.",

        "title": "Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase",
        "text": "Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.\n\nAccording to a report in the Information, Apple \u2014 which just shed around $700 billion as a result of Wall Street's latest tech rout \u2014 has consistently spent over $5 billion annually to beef up its content slate since launching in 2019. That number, though, dramatically decreased to just about $500 million last year, the report said.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.\n\nThe update comes as many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. More streaming platforms are cracking down on password sharers and have also bundled their respective offerings to prevent churn, or users abandoning their subscription plans.\n\nLast year, Apple partnered with Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) to launch a new bundle dubbed StreamSaver, exclusively available to Comcast broadband internet service customers for a cost of $15 a month. The monthly price of a solo Apple TV+ subscription currently sits at $9.99, although users can bundle Apple's streaming service with other Apple-related products like Apple Arcade and Apple News+.\n\nIt's unclear whether the recent bundles are helping.\n\nAccording to data compiled by subscription analytics platform Antenna, Apple's streaming service had the highest churn percentage of all the major streaming platforms, with the exclusion of Starz, with 7% of users churning out of the service during the month of February, compared to just 2% of users for Netflix and 4% of users for Disney+.\n\nNotably, Apple has adopted a strategy different from that of its competitors. For one, its content slate is more limited, although it does boast highly acclaimed titles, including award-winning series like \"Severance,\" \"Shrinking,\" and \"Ted Lasso.\" It was also the first streaming platform to take home an Oscar win for best picture (thanks to \"Coda\").\n\nIn total, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's January earnings call.\n\nApple TV+ does not release subscriber figures, although analysts have pegged total users at anywhere from 30 million to 40 million. Compared to Netflix, which boasts over 300 million subscribers thanks to its substantial global presence, Apple TV+ does not have high penetration in emerging markets, which have become increasingly important drivers as streaming hits peak saturation levels in the US and Canada.\n\n\"Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,\" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. \"Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.\"\n\nIn January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue for the division climbed to $26.34 billion for the period, compared to $23.12 billion in the prior year.",

Trump threatened to slap a 200% tariff on all wines and other alcoholic products coming from the EU if the bloc went ahead with this.\n\nThe Trump administration is also planning further tariffs on April 2.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said on Sunday that the EU was probably mistaken in targeting American whiskey, while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni cautioned EU partners on Tuesday against escalating the trade dispute with the United States.\n\n\"I am not certain that responding to tariffs with more tariffs is necessarily a good deal,\" Meloni, who is close to Trump, said.",

        "text": "March 20 (Reuters) - Washington's temporary relief for import tariffs on goods covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has triggered a spike in US companies seeking exemption under the trade deal, industry experts said.\n\nThe White House slapped fresh 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico on March 5, but later announced that levies on goods covered under the USMCA would be delayed until April 2.\n\nThe USMCA grants preferential treatment to goods either sourced from or having a minimum percentage of value added in any of the three countries.\n\n\"We're seeing importers rush to become USMCA certified ... the risk is just too high not to,\" said Brian Riley, senior vice president of customs house brokerage at logistics firm GEODIS.\n\nSome of the companies, mostly small businesses reliant on cross-border trade, are scrambling to verify if their products already qualify for exemptions.\n\nAt present, only 37.8% of imports from Canada and 48.9% from Mexico are eligible for duty-free status under the USMCA, an S&P Global Market Intelligence report showed.\n\nTo qualify, an importer must analyze the bill of materials - a list of all parts and materials used in a product - to determine if their goods meet requirements.\n\nMike Short, president of Global Forwarding at freight forwarder C.H. Robinson, said there was an increase of USMCA qualification and tariff classification requests even before the official announcement.\n\n\"Now that the official amendments are published, these requests have only increased, and we expect this trend to continue.\"\n\nBusinesses earlier refrained from getting the certification due to its complexity and costs of meeting requirements, especially since their goods were already entering the U.S. duty free.\n\nEven after certification, a company has to maintain detailed records for up to five years after import and ensure continued compliance.\n\n\"Companies are hedging their bets by becoming USMCA certified because what's to say the exemption may not continue after April 2? Or, if the exemption expires then, what if it returns in the near future?\" GEODIS' Riley said.\n\nThe uncertainty has prompted companies to overlook immediate cost-savings.\n\n\"If you are slapping 25-50% tariffs on everything, companies that never previously needed to are now forced to evaluate if this (USMCA certification) is an option,\" said Sung Choi, vice-president of product management at supply chain solutions provider e2open.",

They operate using a unique opportunistic buying model, purchasing surplus inventory, discontinued products, and closeout deals from manufacturers and retailers, which allows them to give customers good deals on quality products.\u00a0\n\nI do think that they are due for a breakout, despite the fact that their stock has been consistantly bearish over the last few years.\u00a0\n\n#######\n\n1. **Recession-Proof during pandemics: Grocery Outlet crushes it during economic downturns. During 2020 (yall know what happened ) they saw growth of up to 50% over the year. As inflation squeezes consumers, they flock to bargain stores.**\n\n2. **Rapid Expansion Mode:** They've been opening new stores aggressively, strategically targeting suburban markets. New stores mean more market penetration, higher revenue, and stronger growth potential. Last year they opened 67 new stores, only closing 2.\n\n3. Insider buying: Director Thomas Herman recently bought around 10,000 shares in open market transactions (Source: Yahoo Finance, SEC filings). Insider buying like this indicates strong belief in the stock's upward trajectory.\n\n4. **Undervalued Against Competitors:**\u00a0Still undervalued compared to places like Dollar General or Aldi, Grocery Outlet offers major upside potential. I do think that they have more room to go down in price, possibly leading to better buying opportunities over the next year or two.\u00a0\n\n5. **Personal Shopper Experience:** Personally, I regularly shop at Grocery Outlet and consistently find high-quality foods and goods at great prices. The store constantly rotates new products every month, keeping the shopping experience fresh and exciting. It's a great option for people like me who don't already have lots of extra money but prefer to purchase quality goods at lower prices. I generally get a better vibe shopping at a place like grocery outlet vs other discount grocery stores. It feels like a normal shopping experience, unlike Aldis where they make you bag your own groceries.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I'm just curious why the stock doesn't seem to get all that much volume compared to other retailers. I'm thinking of buying Long calls, but I'm also waiting to see how the price fluctuates before entering into a position over the next few months, perhaps waiting until their next earning? I'm also wondering how recent tarrifs or supply chain issues would affect GOs viability long term. What do you guys think? I think it's a stock worth observing and dca over the next year or two, or buying into long calls at cheap prices.\n\n\n\ntldr: gogogo for GO\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "Written by /u/enigmasaurus-\n\"I've said it before, this man is basically Elizabeth Holmes.\nYeah sure, he \"has a product\" - but this doesn't change the fact most of tesla's value is built on grift, speculation and a cult of personality.\n\nNow that grift is no longer working and the cult of personality has been destroyed, Elon is desperately trying to shift his target audience - but his new target audience are not his target market. The new Elon fans are not the people likely (or even able) to go out and spend tens of thousands on an EV - no amount of begging on the White House lawn is going to change this.\n\nBack to the grift - Tesla also has been caught making fraudulent sales to claim subsidies in Canada, apparently selling 8600 over 4 days between 4 dealerships in one city (something that is mathematically impossible and would require a sale every two minutes 24 hours a day for that period).\nTesla has engaged in over a decade of constant, deceptive marketing, often wildly exaggerating the capabilities of its products. (Just one example, how's that tesla roadster going? The one that thousands of people put down-payments on in 2018?) They've also been caught exaggerating their battery range by as much as 50% - they've been fined for this in some countries e.g. South Korea. They have a history of deceiving consumers, and this erodes consumer trust.\n\nTesla's existing models are also very underwhelming and stagnant.\nWe've got cybertrucks with panels flying off, being bricked just because they get wet etc. As a truck, they're extraordinarily fragile. The standard models also have all sorts of issues consumers report - doors don't line up properly, the panels feel cheap or break, the controls look like someone just slapped an ipad onto the dash which was cool in 2012 but now it just looks tacky, you feel every bump in the road. Yes other car manufacturers have problems but teslas are not cheap. They're not a bad car, but they're not a car that justifies their price.\n\nAll this is in the context of an auto market being rapidly flooded with other EV models that are better and cheaper than Tesla. Almost every car manufacturer is now making or plans to make EVs - some plan to switch almost entirely to EVs. Tesla no longer feels innovative or competitive.\nSo even if tesla were completely above board - even putting aside the CEO doing literal Nazi salutes or leaning into very public and decisive political activities, the company lost its competitive edge years ago.\nIt enjoyed a wild upsurge at a time when covid-fuelled chip manufacturing delays made accessing standard cars temporarily difficult, and when EVs were popular due to a rise in government incentives. They grew exponentially because for a brief moment, they were just about the only offering in an EV market consumers wanted to be part of. That is gone. Totally, irrevocably gone.\n\nJust three years ago, it was very difficult to obtain any alternative to tesla in the EV market. If you wanted an EV, you bought a tesla, and many people did want an EV. They're cheap to run, they make sense for many people. Two years ago there were very long delays accessing other cars like the ioniq, as these models just hadn't ramped up production quickly enough to meet demand.\nBut that time has well and truly passed. It is now very, very easy to buy any number of great EVs. The market is full of options and tesla is stuck in 2012; its older models have barely changed, its new offerings are objectively terrible cars. It has done next to nothing to actually earn its place in the market. Its competitive edge is gone.\n\nThe stock isn't collapsing because of people hating Elon or boycotting the product (or this isn't the main reason). Tesla is collapsing because people have collectively realized its share price does not and never will align with its current delusional valuation.\nThe bubble has burst. It is a Dutch Tulip. It is not worth more than most other car companies combined and it never fucking was.\"\n\nEdit: paragraphs",

        "text": "Jerome Powell did not shy away from the impact of President Trump\u2019s tariffs during a highly anticipated press conference Wednesday.\n\nThe Federal Reserve chairman said in no uncertain terms that Trump's trade agenda would be likely to drive up prices, even amid considerable uncertainty about exactly how much \u2014 and whether the price changes would be \"transitory.\"\n\nIn just one example Wednesday afternoon during a question about price stability, Powell said that inflation had previously neared the Fed's key goal but now \"I do think with the arrival of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed.\"\n\nIt was just one of numerous comments from the central banker that contrasted with past meetings where he often declined to weigh in on the topic in detail.\n\nThe remarks from Powell came after the Fed on Wednesday decided to hold interest rates steady and maintained a prediction of two rate cuts later this year.\n\nWhat the central bank did change was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower). And those upward inflation adjustments, Powell said, are \"really due to the tariffs coming in.\"\n\nUS Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Monetary Policy Committee meeting, at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC on March 19, 2025. Powell said Wednesday that inflation has started to rise in part due to President Donald Trump\\&#39;s tariffs, although stressing that it is tough to isolate the effects of levies on price increases. \n\nSome analysts raised questions about the Fed's unchanged overall prediction of two cuts this year even as Trump's trade policy has roiled markets and cut back projections of economic growth for the remainder of the year.\n\n\"We continue to think that Fed officials are underestimating the extent to which tariffs are likely to push up inflation,\" Capitol Economics said in a note immediately after Wednesday's decision but before the press conference.\n\nTrump has already levied new duties on China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as on steel and aluminum in his first months in office, with a key deadline on April 2 threatening reciprocal tariffs that could be historic in their breadth and scope.\n\n**A potential for 'transitory' tariff inflation**\n\nAt other points in his press conference Wednesday, Powell also repeatedly said that the exact effects of tariffs on prices were uncertain, may never be exactly known, and could even be temporary.\n\nHe called the price effects of tariffs potentially \"transitory\" \u2014 reusing a much-scrutinized word that was deployed by the Fed and other economic officials in 2021 as prices started to rise during Joe Biden's presidency.\n\nPowell then called a transitory effect on prices \"kind of the base case but we really can't know that\" as he maintained the Fed's long-held wait-and-see approach to actually responding to Trump's still unfolding economic agenda.\n\nBut the use of the loaded word also led to some immediate critiques.\n\nMohamed A. El-Erian, the president of Queens' College, quickly posted, \"I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility.\"\n\nThe centrality of tariffs also led to critiques from Democrats.\n\nDaniel Hornung, deputy director of the National Economic Council under Joe Biden, said in a statement that the changed projections are \"all about tariffs and policy uncertainty,\" adding that \"these are the major factors standing in the way of interest rates coming down.\"\n\nPowell's acknowledgments Wednesday contrasted past Fed meetings, where Powell often made clear that Trump's incoming policies were on his mind without going into much detail on whether a new round of tariffs would cause inflation.\n\nIn one moment last December, Powell held up a September 2018 \"Tealbook\" simulation on tariffs and prices and called them \"a good starting point\" but declined to weigh in much further on then-President-elect Trump's policies.\n\nAt the Fed's last meeting in January, just days after Trump's inauguration, the committee noticeably removed language about inflation making progress toward its 2% inflation goal.\n\nThis time around, Powell was clear he viewed the tariffs as a headwind against his efforts to get inflation to its 2% target but maintained confidence that the central bank could handle it.\n\n\"We think our policy is in a good place to react to what comes,\" he said.",

        "title": "What's TSLA worth in a fire sale?",
        "text": "Occasionally, I see people suggest TSLA could go to $0. Obviously, any company can go to $0 if it's mismanaged for long enough, so sure, TSLA could go to $0. But some people have explicitly claimed that TSLA is basically a dead man walking, and could go to $0 any day now. This seems wrong, and it's kind of become a pet peeve for me.  \n  \nBut what's the right answer? What's TSLA worth if tomorrow Elon Musk has a psychotic break tomorrow and is filmed running naked through the National Mall, a la the Kony 2012 guy?\n\nTesla's [most recent annual financial statement](https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings) lists a \"stockholder's equity\" also known as book value, of $72.913 billion. Divide by 3.22 billion shares and you get the [reported of book value per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics/) $22.67. (My calculator says $22.64 but I assume that's a rounding error.)\n\nThat $72.913 billion book value comes from $122.070 billion in assets, including $58.360 billion in \"current assets\", less $48.390 billion in liabilities. Now according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_asset):\n\n>In accounting, a current asset is an asset that can reasonably be expected to be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year, operating cycle, or financial year. In simple terms, current assets are assets that are held for a short period.\n\nIf you look at the details of the balance sheet, the current assets are mostly stuff that would retain its value pretty well in a disaster, stuff like \"cash\" and \"short-term investments\". Strictly speaking if TSLA is holding a one-year bond its value on March 19th might be more or less than it was worth on December 31st, but assuming the value is unchanged isn't the worst assumption. The big exception, AFAICT, is \"inventory\", of which the balance sheet shows $12.017 billion.\n\nNow, if you assume that when TMZ posts that naked Elon Musk video, all Tesla's inventory and all its non-current assets become worthless, yeah that bankrupts the company. But that's pretty clearly a bad assumption. The inventory might have to be marked down, but to $0? Maybe no hypothetical acquirer wants a Cybertruck factory, but factories can be retooled. Placing a market sell for Tesla's $1.076 billion worth of crypto might not return much cash, but presumably an acquirer wouldn't be that stupid. And I'm not an accountant, but \"deferred tax assets\" (valued at $6.524 billion) sound like something an acquirer might value at close to par?\n\nSo maybe we mark down Tesla's inventory by half (\\~$6.009 billion); we mark down its crypto, which is overwhelmingly Bitcoin, based on how much Bitcoin has declined since December 31st (\\~$0.078 billion), and we mark down other non-current assets (excepting deferred tax assets) by half (\\~$28.133 billion), which gives us a fire sale value of about $38.69 billion or about $12/share.\n\nI'm a software engineer, not an accountant or investment banker, so someone with more expertise in fundamentals analysis than I could probably come up with a better estimate than $12/share. But the fact remains you probably shouldn't place any bets that depend on TSLA going to $0 by end of next week.\n\nEven though, yeah, fuck Elon.\n\nAnyway, here's my position, which I'm holding today's movement be damned:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/54e9pmb12qpe1.png?width=2108&format=png&auto=webp&s=7791bef7a42fd4352703cf3212cee8399c6e6d59",

But the White House official said any such deals would need to be negotiated in advance to avoid the new tariffs.\n\n# DETAILED WORK\n\nThe dueling comments illustrate the developing nature of Trump's new reciprocal tariffs just two weeks out from the April 2 activation deadline.Details of the plan are still being worked out, one White House official said, with much of the technical work on the expected tariffs being led by the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office, headed by Jamieson Greer, and his staff of some 200 people at USTR.Vice President JD Vance has also played a more active role in the discussions in recent weeks, the official said.A spokesperson for USTR did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reciprocal tariff plan.Greer and his staff have been wrestling with how to design the reciprocal tariffs given each of the 186 members of the World Customs Organization has different duty rates, sources familiar with the process said.Calculating the tariff rates is complicated by Trump's vow to reflect the impact of non-tariff barriers, including taxes and other measures that U.S. officials argue give other countries\u2019 firms an unfair advantage.At the Commerce and Treasury departments, political appointees have also run into hiring delays linked to vetting, which has created some negotiating bottlenecks, the same sources familiar with the process said.Financial markets have become increasingly nervous about the impact of Trump's tariffs and retaliation from trading partners will have on inflation and economic growth. U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's rate decision on Wednesday.\n\n# TRIGGERING TALKS\n\nThe Trump administration expects the tariff announcements to trigger offers by affected countries to reduce their own tariffs or non-tariff measures, the official said, noting that India, for one, was already trying to get ahead of the U.S. moves.After Indian Prime Minister\u00a0[Narendra Modi](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-modi-says-trump-has-clear-roadmap-second-term-2025-03-17/)\u00a0and Trump met last month, the two nations agreed to resolve tariff rows and work on the first segment of a deal by the fall of 2025, aiming to reach two-way trade of $500 billion by 2030.\n\nTrump often singles out India as the country with the highest average tariff rates, among top trading partners, while European Union countries are criticized for their high 10% car tariff rate, which is four times the 2.5% U.S. passenger car rate, but less than the 25% U.S. tariff on pickup trucks.Bessent said that the Trump administration is particularly focused on the 15% of countries that have the highest tariffs and large trading volumes with the U.S., which he referred to as the \"Dirty 15.\"These countries also often have regulations governing domestic content or food safety that conspire to keep U.S. products out of their markets, he said.British business and trade minister Jonathan Reynolds came to Washington this week to meet in person with Lutnick and Greer, with both sides talking up the prospects of a bilateral trade deal focused on technology.Summary\n\n* Negotiations to lower tariffs needed ahead of April 2Countries to get tariff number on April 2, Bessent says\n* Bessent sees opportunity to negotiate tariffs lower\n* USTR wrestling with design of complex reciprocal tariff plan\n* White House official says tariffs to take effect April 2\n* Negotiations to lower tariffs needed ahead of April 2Countries to get tariff number on April 2, Bessent says\n* Bessent sees opportunity to negotiate tariffs lower\n* USTR wrestling with design of complex reciprocal tariff plan",

        "text": "In short, buy TLT calls. In long...\n\n# Introduction\n\nFellow regards, I\u2019m sure we are all aware that the all Powell-ful Jerome will be determining, at the Fed meeting today, how hard a fucking our significant other\u2019s boyfriend will be pumping out. Yet fewer have discussed what move they will be making based on this situation. My thesis is simple - the market has mispriced the chance of a rate cut, underestimating it, and so to take advantage of that, I have am in a long TLT position - a highly-leveragable, long-term government bond ETF. I\u2019ll first explain why I think there\u2019s a higher chance of a rate slash than the market is telling us, specifically diving into why the market has been mispriced. I\u2019ll then move onto why this will cause TLT to rise, and also why I\u2019ve chosen TLT over other related assets.\n\n# Why an interest rate cut seems likely to me\n\nLet\u2019s start with some basic economics. Modern monetary theory suggests that the FED uses interest rate hikes to lower inflation at the cost of weakening the economy (raising unemployment), while cuts strengthen the economy while causing inflation. Here's how our situation looks to me:\n\nFirst, consider inflation. To be completely honest, I have been working on this thesis since before the release of CPI data for February - personally, I expected annual inflation, from January to February, to fall from 3% to 2.9%. So, I waited until March 10th for a bit of confirmation bias. I was greeted by:\n\n[Fig 1.1. CPI for February 2025, all goods](https://preview.redd.it/hr2m6snl1npe1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=30e0d3b370fff5664846a1fc00fcf019370518e0)\n\n[Fig 1.2. 12-month inflation of February 2025, all goods](https://preview.redd.it/58duajjt1npe1.png?width=2464&format=png&auto=webp&s=7504887c1cdb54bb6655364ac732cd031b5fb310)\n\nInflation has retreated more than expected, falling to 2.8%. One of the many reasons why an interest rate cut initially seemed unlikely was  due to concerns of sticky inflation - this has provided evidence that inflation is falling. Granted, fed changes are not instant, and I\u2019ll address fears regarding inflation later on in more detail. However, this data has shown us that inflation isn't as bad as we thought it'd be, and seems to be falling - evidence in favour of a rate cut happening.\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, the economy:\n\n[Fig 2.1. Consumer sentiment data](https://preview.redd.it/j9khkay22npe1.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=3844b51954a3e6f01801e10ba3334e014d3d6713)\n\nConsumer sentiment has completely crashed, falling 10% from Febuary to March, with expectations showing an even bleaker result\n\n[Fig 2.2. Consumer spending falls in January 2025](https://preview.redd.it/dp7hgvg82npe1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc1d6630a4380931629607fe431db721b62a781)\n\nActual spending has also fallen - for the first time in a long time, people are spending less, despite easing inflation. And while preliminary data has appeared for February showing consumer spending has gone back up by 0.2%, this is still underperforming expectations. A weak consumer base, unwilling to spend, is never a good sign.\n\n[Fig 2.3. ISM Manufacturing\u00a0- PMI Index](https://preview.redd.it/cwzyk03j2npe1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0197772d801cd7f15e9f317e79c0199b0fb163d)\n\n[Fig 2.4. A more detailed look at the index](https://preview.redd.it/eg6p861q2npe1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=9137514ca9dc0db417be1cd38bf9252c809451a0)\n\nThe manufacturing index has also seen better days. The manufacturing PMI has fallen from 50.9 to 50.3 in February. Now, in all fairness, this still means there is growth - any score above 50 indicates expansion - however, it means that growth is slowing down and seems to be at an inflection point, where it\u2019ll start contracting again. Looking at the specifics, we also see details that show new orders and employment numbers are contracting, production and exports are seeing reduced growth, all while imports are growing at an accelerated pace. None of these show the signs of a confident economy. But perhaps most important to us degenerates, the stock market worries:\n\n[Fig 2.5. Trillions wiped off the stock market in the last 2 weeks](https://preview.redd.it/0mndpd1v2npe1.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0a513492d726a76f2b3c57b054ac238b7e89f8f)\n\nI\u2019m sure all of us remember last week, when our portfolios got bent over by trump refusing to rule out a recession. A recession. I don\u2019t think it can be spelled out any clearer to even the passengers of the shortest of buses - Trump does not seem to mind, and in fact is open accepting of recession\n\n[Fig 2.6. Google searches for recession surging](https://preview.redd.it/5xev3p0w3npe1.png?width=2338&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3f642682041e45ebcd926105b0be2647892d509)\n\nAnother decent indicator of recession is also the number of google searches you see for it - clearly, we're amidst another breakout.\n\n[Fig 2.7. Holy fucking shit](https://preview.redd.it/v6p7emz44npe1.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea9eae8a32a16633f308444716a58e680b97de93)\n\nThe long and short of it is that it\u2019s not looking good. Crashing consumer expectations, cratering stock prices, manufacturing slowdowns - they all paint the picture of a recession coming up. Thus, with inflation not too bad, I believe that the FED should prioritise bringing back economic growth over keeping inflation down.\n\n# A mispricing in the market\n\nSo, given the sorry state of our economy and comparatively better inflation control, you'd expect the market to price the chance of an interest rate cut at 40%, maybe 20%, maybe very low end, 5%. In reality...\n\n1 per cent\n\nAccording to a popular betting market, there is just a 1% chance Powell will change the interest rate today. Now of course, the betting market does not automatically correspond to what the stock market is thinking - however, any investor that sees an obvious arbitrage opportunity like this would be able to make a 100-fold return against tens of millions of dollars of liquidity if the stock market disagreed, so it seems to me that this accurately reflects the general sentiment.\n\nHere's the most important part of my DD that I want to emphasise. In fact, if there\u2019s any takeaway from my DD, let it be this:\n\nI am **not** telling you Jerome will definitely cut rates tomorrow. In fact, anyone claiming to know for sure what Jerome will do tomorrow either has inside information, is lying, or is grossly misinformed. The first group will never talk to the likes of us, the second group is taking advantage of the likes of us, and the third group belongs among the likes of us.\u00a0\n\nNo, all my DD hinges upon is the idea that the chance of an interest rate cut is higher than 1%. That\u2019s all you need - the thought that interest rate cuts aren't being priced in correctly, and that\u2019s where any real money is made - mispricings in the market. I personally don\u2019t see how the chance of an interest rate cut is not higher than 5% - if your takeaway from my analysis is that it will be anything above 1%, you too believe, there is a mispricing in the market, and can profit from purchasing TLT.\u00a0\n\nSo this begs the question of why there's a market mispricing\n\n# Why is there a mispricing / \u201cBut you\u2019re forgetting about\u2026\u201d\n\nThere are a couple ideas that people can bring up to suggest why interest rate cuts are unlikely - I\u2019ll try and cover the main ones and deliver a rebuttal on all of them.\n\nFirstly, there\u2019s concern of inflation from Trump\u2019s tariffs. This is not unfounded - tariffs are inflationary, and perhaps the worry of inflation is too great to cut rates. Firstly, I\u2019d like to point out that many of Trump\u2019s other policies are deflationary: deregulation and government spending cuts are both deflationary, and I don\u2019t think we truly realise how likely \u201ctail-end events\u201d like cutting half of military spending is with an unpredictable guy like Trump - he\u2019s discussed it before. Secondly, Jerome Powell himself has stated, at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business on March 7th, that tariffs may cause a one off price hike, but that \u201clonger-term expectations remain stable and consistent with our 2% inflation goal\u201d. A one-off rise in inflation will not need to be adjusted for - as Powell correctly ascertains, policies should only deal with persistent inflation.\n\nSecondly, some will mention that Powell himself has said before that it is not in a hurry to cut interest rates. I will point out that these quotes are all from before March 10th, before Trump refused to rule out the chance of a recession, before the stock market plummeted and lost trillions of dollars, and before we saw consumer confidence sour so drastically. The situation has changed, and Powell is now much more likely to slash rates.\n\nFinally, the previous point already alludes to this, but one idea is that there\u2019s a conflict between Trump and Powell, in the way that Trump is almost trying to cause economic panic to force Powell into lowering interest rates. People will have you believe that big J, in an attempt to win this dick-swinging contest, will refuse to back down and keep interest rates constant. Maybe, maybe, but what's more important than winning the measuring contest is preventing the ruin that will come to millions if we fail to cushion economic downturn. Jerome does not want to be the guy who failed to do enough and saw America go through a recession or worse. In fact, I\u2019ll go so far as to say the opposite - I think Powell is likely to fold now due to his past expereince. Many criticisms have been levelled against the man on account of the fact that he didn\u2019t hike rates early enough in 2021, which led to out-of-control inflation. I think that it\u2019s likely that he has learned from this mistake, and I\u2019d err on him acting sooner rather than later on cutting rates.\n\nMost important to keep in mind however, is that maybe you still have doubts about if Jerome is likely to cut interest rates. Keep in mind - we\u2019re not asking if it\u2019s more likely he\u2019ll cut rates or keep them the same. We\u2019re asking if the market is mispriced - if the chance he\u2019ll cut rates is higher than 1%. Any bit of edge is a bullish indication for TLT.\n\n# Ok, I think the chance of a cut is higher than 1%. How do I make money off that\n\nMinimising risk. It's arguably the one of the core tenets of the stock market - the idea of a net worth rising in a safe and predictable straight line is tantalising to all but the most degenerate regard. It's why so many rich people are willing to take a below-market return from a hedge fund - there's a team of brilliant Asian quants out there who, instead of curing cancer or perfecting interplanetary travel, are creating the most ridiculous and incomprehensible financial products to tame risky and volatile assets into neat little beta neutral, uncorrelated returns that beat the risk free rate by half a percent, all for the price of a 2/20 fee structure. There's money to be made in lowering risk.\n\nHowever, you\u2019re in the wrong subreddit if you\u2019re that brilliant Asian quant. As such, we\u2019ll be doing the opposite - taking the safest investment in the world - US treasury bonds, and jacking it up to the tits in leverage to increase risk, in return for enlarged profits.\n\nFirstly, treasury bonds are the asset of choice because I think that they will have the largest quick movement due to this mispricing in the market. Stock markets react unpredictably to interest rate movements - bonds do not. For those who don\u2019t know, when interest rates fall, all new government bonds issued have lower coupon rates. As such, the old government bonds, with comparatively higher coupon rates, rise in value. This is why \u201cgovernment bonds rise in value when rates are cut, and vice versa\u201d. This is even more so for long-term treasury bonds compared to short-term bills - since the coupon is paid out many more times, the rise in value is exaggerated too.\n\nThe liquid variety for long-term treasury bonds is the TLT, an ETF that tracks the bond price. Not only is the liquidity a plus, but the asset being an ETF allows you to buy options on it, letting you purchase different calls until you are sufficiently leveraged for your personal risk tolerance.\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019m a broke ass college student who has an evil, satanic, institutional broker that doesn't allow me to buy options. So, I\u2019ve spent about half my money on TLT shares.\u00a0\n\n[My 50 shares of TLT](https://preview.redd.it/tbh4scdn6npe1.png?width=2346&format=png&auto=webp&s=82ee7bedc1831d8ef90a20c15b062fcedfd5121a)\n\n# What Next\n\nNow, of course, I don\u2019t know for sure if Jerome will cut rates. Here are my rough plans based on what happens next:\n\n1. Rates get cut:\n\nI\u2019d expect TLT to rise sharply, due to the market not expecting this cut. Happy days. Probably sell and throw the money into a global fund, or maybe hold onto the position, anticipating more cuts throughout the year.\n\n2. Rates don\u2019t move:\n\nThen in this case, TLT probably won\u2019t move significantly, since the market is pretty much expecting this outcome. I\u2019d probably hold onto my position a bit longer, since if he\u2019s not cutting now, he needs to cut by May. This would also probably give me a generally bearish attitude on the US economy and stocks - I think this would be cutting rates a little too late. Probably start throwing more of my money into bonds and international markets.\n\nEither way, I think that this mispricing in the market can be capitalised on. Good luck regards!\n\ntl;dr - Due to a weak economy, I think there\u2019s a higher than 1% chance rates will be cut (the market prediction), therefore, the markets have priced TLT too low",

I think this is a no brainer. \n\nBonds are just starting to recover from its historical bear market from 2022 through 2024. Rates haven\u2019t been as high since 2007 and we all know how that went. \n\nEveryone is worried about inflation. The trend is down. Everyone knows the stock market doesn\u2019t go up in a straight line. Why isn\u2019t this thinking extrapolated across all data sets. \n\nUnpopular opinion. Tariffs may have a minor, immediate uptick in inflation but are highly deflationary after. When prices are raised higher than what demand is (especially combined with a mass catchup on goods production from COVID), it craters prices. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff act of 1930 worsened the Great Depression, a highly deflationary time period.",
            "I\u2019ve read the whole thing and I agree with most except the execution. The bond market is the most rigid, monitored and therefore the most transparent of all the asset classes. It\u2019s because most pension funds, hedge funds and even volatility traders trade and use interest rate swaps. The delta of every book is monitored constantly. Unlike the stock market which is often deemed risky and volatile by most funds because of degenerates like us. The only time a really big profit has been made with bonds mis pricing is when a country almost goes bankrupt (like Greece, Portugal or Spain)\n\nThen we have the monetary vs fiscal debate which I think is more interesting and potentially profitable. When Dems was in charge, montary and fiscal policy were kind of aligned. Dems flooded the market with free credit and Powell tightened to prevent sky high inflation.\n\nHowever because the new admin and Powell don\u2019t get along, we potentially get a fiscal vs monetary stand off. Powell will do what\u2019s best for the country but the new admin might not. So how to profit? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple because macro economics don\u2019t clearly translate into a stock play\n\nYou need to think of something like the Tesla guy around the elections.

        "text": "**CRSP Investment Thesis**\n\n**TLDR**: Innovative biotech company that is currently ramping up sales of its new innovative medicine, which is the new standard of care in sickle cell disease. Large pipeline may lead to 50X growth from here according to CEO\u2019s lofty goals. Several catalysts are expected in April/May and June/July timeframe, including updates Q1 earnings (updates on Casgevy sales) and data readouts on clinical programs. Outstanding question: is the healthcare system ready for curative one-time therapies, as compared to daily or weekly treatments.\n\n*My Credentials:* I have a MS in Biotech and wrapping up my MBA in healthcare. I have worked in Pharma business development for a few years now. I have been following CRSP since its IPO in 2018.\n\n*My position:*\n\n[Adding more on dips](https://preview.redd.it/5if8gtja9jpe1.png?width=2156&format=png&auto=webp&s=308e2ceb065c32bcc0f5a67050baa8e65715c77e)\n\n**Background**\n\nCRSP is a company developing medicine for genetic diseases using CRISPR gene editing technology. The scientists who discovered this technology won the Nobel Prize in 2020. CRSP has one marketed product, Casgvey, that was developed via a collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals to treat sickle cell disease. They have a profit sharing arrangement, which entitles them to 40% of all profits from Casgevy, while Vertex manages the commercialization. This is great because they have a built-up commercial team which has shown success at getting reimbursement from insurance and getting doctors to prescribe expensive treatments.\n\nThe CEO says that they hope to be $100B biotech one day!!\n\n\\*\\*Financials (\\*\\*As of 3/18/2025)\n\nMarket Cap = $3.67B; Enterprise Value = $1.8B\n\nNet Cash = $1.9B\n\nShort interest = 24.7% of the float (significant short squeeze potential)\n\n\\~70% Institutional Investors (Smart Money)\n\nThey have an average operating expenses of \\~$130M/quarter, so absent any revenue from Casgevy we can expect them to have funding to last at least the next three years and by then it is highly likely that there will be significant profits from Casgevy. This means that at the very least the dilution risk very low, which is common among pre-revenue biotech companies and is the main reason why they are often heavily shorted.\n\n**Macro**\n\nRate cut/growth scare means biotech boom.\n\n**Commercial Success**\n\nThe CEO has said that there is tremendous patient interest in the therapy, and more will be convinced as additional long-term safety data is generated. CEO also says that they are currently ramping up approved treatments center - both the number of centers and how many patients each can treat.\n\nSeveral analysts have projected that Casgevy could reach $1B in sales as of 2026 and reach peak sales of $3.5B in 2030, per typical drug sales ramps. As EOY24 there are 50 patients undergoing the Casgevy therapy process, as more treatment centers continue to open. This therapy costs $2.2M and these 50 patients equate to sales of $110 million, but it is unknown when that will be collected and if that is enough for profit to begin flowing to CRSP. It only takes a few dozen patients to be treated for this therapy to yield serious revenue, for example, that $1B target equates to 450 patients being treated, out of a US patient pool of around 30k, who are healthy enough to receive the treatment and have access through insurance. However, this can\u2019t continue forever and once you treat all the available patients, you are only able to treat this disease at the incidence rate (# of babies born with sickle cell) but remember that if Casgevy treats only half of that 30k patient population, it will have made over $33B.\n\nRecently there has been significant process at negotiating access for this therapy on both Medicare/Medicaid and private insurance companies. The consensus insurance approach is outcomes-based agreements (OBA), which would tie a portion of the payments to how well the treatment provide clinical benefit to patients ([Link](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/cgt)). This is critical in providing access to patients and increasing commercial uptake.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at my NPV projections based on the analyst estimates above.\n\nProjected NPV of $6B, considering the enterprise value of $1.8B, this implies upside of \\~233% or a share price of \\~$132. For reference the average analyst price target is \\~$77.\n\n**Assumptions**\n\n|| || |\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Assumes 50% FCF margin| |\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Discount rate of 12%| |\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Perpetual growth of 3% (very conservative, given pipeline)| |\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 40% profit sharing in Casgevy| |\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peak sales for Casgevy in 2030 estimated to be $3.5B| |\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Only values company on Casgevy \u00a0|\n\n**Competitors**\n\nThere is one other gene edit therapy in sickle cell develop by BlueBird, but they essentially just went bankrupt and sold to a private equity for pennies [(Press Release Link)](https://investor.bluebirdbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bluebird-bio-announces-definitive-agreement-be-acquired-carlyle). Not to mention their therapy also has a black box warning for hematological malignancies, which is the kiss of death for therapies where there is a suitable alternative. Who would want to risk getting cancer?\u00a0 Their therapy also costs $1M more than Casgevy.\n\nSince traditional medicine aka the previous standard of care only addressed the symptoms of sickle cell, we expect almost no competition from the current market landscape.\u00a0\n\nThere are likely to be several similar therapies from other gene editing competitor coming to market in the next 3-5 years, but the first-to-market usually secures a solid market share.\n\n**Clinical Pipeline**\n\nCRSP also has a solid extensive pipeline of moderately de-risked assets in development. CEO says that commercial success in Casgevy will fund them to make strategic bets to fill their pipeline with 1-2 new drugs per year.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **CTX310; CTX320** = Two candidates in vivo liver editing programs targeting LPA and ANGPTL3, which expects data to be release in 1H 2025 (recent presentations suggest between early April and early May). The CEO stated that they will benefit from economies of scale. The first program in their liver editing platform will cost \\~$100M and each subsequent one will only cost $15M to develop because it\u2019s a modular platform.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **CTX112; CTX131** = Two allogenic CAR-T cell therapy candidates targeting CD19 and CD70, which expect data to be released in mid-2025 and Q4 2025, respectively. Low COGS on allogenic CAR-Ts make them a very attractive business model, even if clinical data is only OK. AstraZeneca reached paid $1B for EsoBiotec, an allogenic CAR-T platform that is in the clinic. ([Link](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/astrazeneca-buy-esobiotec-upto-1-billion-2025-03-17/))\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **VCTX210; VCTX211** = Two regenerative medicine cell therapy replacement candidates for Type 1 Diabetes, which expects an update in 2H 2025. We should be cautious about expecting much from this because their partner, Vertex, has opted out of ownership and we do not know if that is because they plan to focus on their own cell therapy replacement or if something went wrong in the trial.\u00a0 CEO seemed upbeat about it in a recent presentation.\n\nIt's also important to note that CRSP wholly owns all the clinical programs above, so contrary to Casgevy, they will receive 100% of the profits. Feel free to look at their [pipeline](https://crisprtx.com/pipeline) for more in depth analysis, but that is not the focus of this research.\u00a0 There are also several pre-clinical programs, but those will materially affect the stock price in my view because they are about *at least* 6 years from revenue generation.\n\n**Risks**\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Patients may not want to go through the cell depletion conditioning process required for this treatment - it is like chemotherapy.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Insurance companies may not want to pay for the high price tag of Casgevy ($2.2M), despite the long term clinical and cost benefits. Developing gene editing medicines is not a validated and proven business model (very different economics from small molecules and biologics)\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Safety Risks. Unknown new clinical data could come out which suggests that there are risks associated with CRISPR based medicine compared to more novel and targeted gene editing approaches like base editing or prime editing. Not sure what these would be, but it\u2019s definitely possible.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Efficacy Risks. Any of the their clinical programs might not generate enough efficacy to beat standard of care (however it is widely accepted that precision medicine companies have significantly higher success rates).\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Competitors still in the clinic could deliver better data that would be the new standard of care in sickle cell, which limits long term growths for Casgevy\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cathy Wood is one of their main investors",

        "text": "**Jerome Powell's Speech:**\u00a0Don't be too concerned with Jerome Powell's speech tomorrow, because it will most likely be a copy of his speech from a week ago at the press conference. The market rallied over 1% on that speech as Jerome Powell tried to calm the markets. Mostly consisted of \"wait and see\" and \"the data is still fine\". The truth is we had a decent CPI and Jobs read for Feb, and PMI and consumer Sentiment were mediocre. The Fed simply cannot make a drastic stance on cuts or the economy this early without sufficient data.\n\n**Dot Plot:**\u00a0The most important thing to look for in the FOMC meeting tomorrow is the brand new revised dot plot. Every major investment bank along with CME Fed watch has their current predictions on rate cuts for 2025 at 2-3 cuts (leaning more towards 3). If we see the 19 members of the fed come out tomorrow and say they disagree with that, and we are more likely to stay with 2 cuts for 2025, we could see a sharp repricing down, as rate cuts are very bullish for the equities market. (you are going to want to see more dots shift down to the line right above 3.5)\n\n[Dec 2024 Dot Plot](https://preview.redd.it/5nidotlj2jpe1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=4262ada3bd7032b9e81342eebc1ab8f30fdd4151)\n\n**Summary of Economic Projections:**\u00a0Lastly is if the Fed will project a lower GDP then in there last prediction in December. They currently have it at 2.1% for 2025, which was raised from Sept 2024's prediction of 2.0%. But also note they increased their inflation metrics heavily in December.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjiz1afp2jpe1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c35aa479d40f066919285c8272ab43606015ff\n\nDec 2024 Projections\n\nThe last summary of projections was a sharp change to inflation reigniting due to their cuts, but also that GDP and Unemployment would improve slightly as a result. With new fiscal policies causing fears that we wont get those improvement in GDP or Unemployment, it really puts the Fed in a tough place where these new projections for March almost seem certain to be downgrades.\n\n[GDP 2025 Projections](https://preview.redd.it/yc5hpmu42jpe1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6d1932796db56357111549000d6f577c926191b)\n\nThe other thing to note is that the 2025 GDP projections have the widest distribution of all their 2025 projections. Meaning that the fed members are the most split or undecided on this decision, and that the new data could potentially really swing those numbers down. Opposed to unemployment where 14 of 19 Fed members all picked 4.3% for 2025, and are less likely to all be swayed or moved.\n\n[Unemployment 2025 Projections](https://preview.redd.it/i3xbsfs82jpe1.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0277eed836fe102e11c728f263d4ce3e0c1d205)\n\n**Summary:**\u00a0I personally believe we will get sharp adjustments down to GDP and slightly up to unemployment, while inflation will stay close to the same (maybe lowered a little). If this isn't met with the Dot Plot increasing the Fed's stance from 2 to 3 cuts for 2025 (I have no prediction for this as there are so many factors), expect more short term pain in the markets as investment banks downgrade and reprice assets down.",

        "title": "Can Newly Released NVIDIA Dynamo Open Source Reasoning Software Save NVIDIA's Stock?",
        "text": "First we need to know what the NVIDIA Dynamo Open Source Reasoning Software is for.\n\n\n\nThe above description comprehensively summarizes the main functions and application scenarios of NVIDIA Dynamo, as well as the revolutionary impact it may have on AI inference and its long-term positive effect on the company\u2019s stock price. Specifically:\n\n\n\nSoftware Functions and Application Scenarios\n\n\n\nIntelligent Scheduling and Resource Allocation: Dynamo not only inherits the advantages of the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server but also goes further by dynamically allocating GPU resources to cope with fluctuating inference request volumes, ensuring that each GPU operates at high efficiency even under heavy load.\n\nOptimizing Large Language Model Inference: It adopts a decomposed service strategy, distributing the processing and generation stages of large language models across multiple GPUs, which significantly improves throughput in practical applications. For example, when running the DeepSeek-R1 model on certain rack clusters, the number of tokens generated per GPU can be increased by approximately 30 times.\n\nMulti-Framework Support and Expanded Use Cases: As an open-source software, Dynamo can support various frameworks including PyTorch and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, making it suitable for cloud service providers, data centers, and enterprise AI factories.\n\nRevolutionary Significance\n\n\n\nInnovation in Resource Utilization: By leveraging intelligent routing and dynamic allocation, Dynamo can double performance and revenue with the same hardware resources, fundamentally changing traditional inference deployment methods.\n\nBuilding an Open-Source Ecosystem: Its open-source nature not only promotes standardization and innovation in distributed inference architectures but also fosters collaborative progress across the entire AI industry.\n\nEnhancing Cost Efficiency and Performance: By reducing data transmission and storage costs as well as increasing GPU computational density, the software is expected to make AI services more efficient and cost-competitive.\n\nPotential Impact on NVIDIA\u2019s Stock Price In the long term, Dynamo is expected to help consolidate NVIDIA\u2019s leadership in AI infrastructure, especially as the data center and cloud services segments continue to expand, thereby driving higher revenue and profit growth for the company. Although the market might remain cautious about the immediate results of the new product launch in the short term, the widespread adoption of this technology by more service providers is anticipated to have a positive effect on the stock price.\n\n\n\nWhy do I think NVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Inference Software will have a positive impact on NVDA's stock price?\n\nBecause this software will substantially boost NVIDIA's revenue in data center and cloud services.\n\n\n\nFrom the public earnings data and market expectations, NVIDIA's data center and cloud services business has shown an upward trend in recent years, but it should be noted that the proportion here is subject to quarterly fluctuations, especially in quarters driven by AI demand (e.g., in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, data center revenue once accounted for 90.5%)\n\n[CN.INVESTING.COM](http://CN.INVESTING.COM)\n\n), while the full-year average is much smoother. Estimates based on current public information and analysis:\n\n\n\nFY2023: Data center and cloud services business will account for approximately 43% of total annual revenue.\n\nFY2024: The market expects this to rise to around 50% or so, driven by continued strong AI demand.\n\nFY2025: While some quarters (e.g. Q4) are particularly strong, on average for the year, the share of data center and cloud services is expected to stabilize between 50% and 55%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cmlbnl8uzhpe1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df9b1c9eaab0bea9be735bf3ac72099910fd91eb\n\n",

        "title": "A Guide to the Biggest \"IPO\" in History: trashy DD on FNMA and FMCC",
        "text": "The guide to the biggest \u201cIPO\u201d in history\n\nHello my highly regarded denizens, and let me introduce you to the upcoming insanity that will be surrounding the release of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from the bowels of hell, government bureaucracy, and the OTC. I\u2019m going to lead off with a few basic ways to play this, what kind of red flags I\u2019ll be looking for, and some background and context in case you\u2019re not familiar with this HIGHLY unusual situation.\n\nFirst off, there are two securities you can buy here. The first are the common stock: FNMA and FMCC, for each of the companies. You need to think of these as call options with no theta and delta 1. I\u2019m personally weighted heavily towards these since Inauguration but I\u2019ll get more into that momentarily. Then there are the junior preferred shares, each of which correspond to one of the companies and usually share the first few letters: FNMAS, FNMAT, FNMAJ for Fannie, and FMCCH, FMCKJ, and FMCCO for Freddie. \n\nIn case you\u2019ve been living under a rock or are an active subscriber of The Motley Fool, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the two most profitable companies by employee, and have the largest assets on the face of fucking planet. That\u2019s seven and a half TRILLION dollars in assets. They buy up mortgages from banks, dump \u2018em together in a various pots called securitizations, and basically print money from the payments. Back in 08, the government made a determination based on secret filings that Fannie and Freddie were super dangerous, and would have to print their earnings directly into the Treasury department instead. At the head of this conservatorship, and controlling Fannie and Freddie is the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n\nCurrently, the US Treasury Department owns a million shares of the Senior Preferred Shares (SPS) at a value of around $200 billion. They ALSO own warrants, equal to diluting the common stock by 80%. The Treasury awarded themselves these shares and warrants after forcing Fannie and Freddie to take a loan out on hypothetical losses in 08, and there\u2019s only three men who can do anything about that. Thankfully, they have a raging boner of hatred for the government.\n\nJunior Preferred Shares (JPS) and commons are both available to common investors, but only through the OTC, so Robinhooders are in shambles (again). JPS are more protected but have capped upside; they have a par value (aka a cap in price) of either $25 or $50, and if dividends get turned on again (only after a release, covered below), they get up to 8% of par first, and then commons get the rest. There\u2019s also a fun added bonus round just to make things more complex: JPS and Freddie commons (but not FNMA) will be getting damages awarded after the presiding judge decided to sign off (after waiting TWO years, and yes, you read that right). FMCKJ will be getting something like $3 in damages, and as of 3/17, was trading at $10. \n\nThen there\u2019s common shares. High risk, ultra high reward. Depending on what kind of scenario plays out, we could see share price hitting anything from sub $2 if you believe somnambulant lawyers, to $34 if you believe Bill Ackman, to price targets that you wouldn\u2019t fucking believe until I lay it all.\n\nRight now, here\u2019s the main events:\n\nRelist: Currently commons and JPS languish in OTC purgatory. 20% pops and drops on zero news, zero halts, and lower liquidity than your mother in her memory care unit. Shambles. Rather than an IPO, the companies can follow a much simpler uplisting procedure to the NYSE This will allow institutions to buy who are restricted from OTC trading, as well as making positions marginable, including OPTIONS. Theoretically, they can uplist at any moment.\nRecap: based on arbitrary regulations, Fannie and Freddie have to have some certain amount of money to backstop the loans they guarantee. How much you ask? It entirely depends on who\u2019s in charge? Back when Mark Calabria was running things, they needed like 4.5% of their book as a reserve! Good thing that those capital requirements didn\u2019t stop payments from running straight out of Fannie and Freddie\u2019s wallet into untraceable Treasury accounts! The specific phrase you need to parsing Twitter headlines is \u201cECRF\u201d, which stands for \u201cEverybody Chill, Release Fannie,\u201d letting you know that if the amount is 1.5%, Fannie will be released within a year (it\u2019s just under the capital threshold). If it\u2019s lower than 1.5%, Fannie can be released IMMEDIATELY. Freddie is a little slower, but he works just as hard you guys, and he won\u2019t be far too far behind. \nRelease: dividends get turned back on, justice is restored, and angelic choirs announce the golden age of America.\n\nSo let me give a couple of the RED FLAGS for free. If you see these, FLEE commons. \nWarrant Exercise. We know you\u2019ve been trying hard to forget that reminder about your license being suspended, but this is definitely one warrant you can\u2019t escape. Diluting the float by 80% would absolutely murder commons with no real hope of reprieve. Your only saving grace might be that OTC tends to trade headlines a day or two slow. \nSPS conversion. Just like a regular conversion, this one will also have you on your knees begging for mercy. Basically another form of dilution.\n\u201cNeed for continued study.\u201d You know how when you had that hot band chick over to study, and you kept trying to touch her hand while going over AP Calc homework, but she got angry that you weren\u2019t paying enough attention to what SHE thought was important? This is like that. Without significant internal pressure, government impetus will stop any relist/recap/release movement simply out of being the fact that they\u2019re collectively lazy and stupid. Given that midterms are going to be a distraction for decision makers only 15 months from now, progress needs to be made, and quickly, before GOP control of all three branches is threatened. Specifically, while some of these comments were made by Scott Bessent (now Treasury Secretary) and Bill Pulte (now FHFA Director), that was before they were confirmed, and based on everything I\u2019m seeing, were statements to basically placate the committees. To get released, these companies will need specific and meaningful policy decisions.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m IMAGINING for green flags. Seriously, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of public statements made about these companies, but I think for good reasons, mainly political.\nSPS CANCELLED. There\u2019s several good reasons to believe the Treasury\u2019s stock will just straight go to zero. First, the Treasury has been MORE than paid back on the loans they gave going back to 08; altogether, they got paid $340 billion over a $200 billion loan. This raises serious questions about why the government can simply continue to demand money from organizations it \u2018conserves,\u2019 which was one reason why a jury voted 8-0 to give damages in the Fairholme case. The continued existence of SPS brings into question the very notion of property rights in America.\nWarrants to be sold. There\u2019s a lot of speculation about what the Treasury would do with the warrants after a recap/relist. A popular theory is that the Treasury could gradually sell these assets off, and allocate the money to whatever pet project. This seems pretty likely, given talk about a Sovereign Wealth Fund, and similar procedures with confiscated bitcoins etc. There\u2019s some interesting dynamics where warrants could be sold to fund a SWF, which funds real estate development, which pumps FnF, raising warrant values higher, etc.\nWarrants to be CANCELLED. The ultimate bull case. If this happens, commons will launch to Mars and legends will be made. Some say the \u201cgovernment\u201d would never go for this. I say the government is run by the same man who brought us TRUMPCOIN on Inauguration weekend, and we can\u2019t even know if he has a position since filings on OTC are VOLUNTARY. Sure would be quite an ARTFUL DEAL if the decision maker about FHFA actions just so happened to have a position.\n\nSo where are we at with this?\nTrump: a man with significant real estate holdings and a desire to eliminate government agencies wholesale.\nBessent: confirmed Treasury Secretary with a desire to privatize everything in sight.\nPulte: confirmed FHFA director, who on the first day, declared himself Chairman of the Board for FnF and cleared house on the board. \nAt this point I\u2019m basically just waiting for an announcement. It will probably come from Bessent who will declare something about having made an agreement with Pulte to wind down FHFA, but I wouldn\u2019t put it past Trump to announce an executive order just ending it, a la USAID. There hasn\u2019t been much specifically said, but there is a forest of legal red tape surrounding this thing. While there could be progress made on the legal front (final motion in Fairholme damages was finally dismissed after waiting two years, and the case still isn\u2019t even certified!), this is ultimately a political question and it seems like all the stars have aligned. \n\nPositions: I've been selling JPS to capture some more volatility out of commons, I plan to rotate around a bit. \n\n\"But you're already up a lot\" dipshit, tell me if it makes any sense for a $3 dividend to trade at $6. \n\n\"You just want exit liquidity\" you just want to be able to breathe through your nose, but that doesn't stop you from buying BABA with less volume on the NYSE than EITHER Fannie or Freddie on the OTC. \n\nThis post is only for informational purposes, since raccoons are not able to give financial advice. Fuck you and your opposable thumbs.\n",

The condition of the battery is a major key factor in the value of the entire car which is why we have been starting to see Teslas, Leaf and other older EVs get financially totaled when a battery replacement is needed. With battery swapping you have no idea what condition the battery you are getting you could theoretically have a nearly brand new car that been pampered only slow charged to getting swapped a battery from a car that's been ragged on and regularly fast charged. That means unless you have a system where you can go back and get your original battery back you have just reduced your brand new car value drastically all because you decided to take a road trip.",

Wiz and its investors balked at the deal in part because of worries of a protracted regulatory approval process, with competition authorities in the US and Europe focusing on the tech sector for its economic sway and market power. \n\n> Chief Executive Officer Assaf Rappaport, who described last year\u2019s offer as \u201chumbling,\u201d also said he relished the idea of growing Wiz into an independent cybersecurity giant, to compete against the likes of CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. and Palo Alto Networks.\n\n> Started by Israelis and based in New York, Wiz\u2019s investors include Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Cyberstarts. Last year, the company was valued at $12 billion in a funding round.",

Like we have to see how it trades but it looks pretty likely the Fed is going to set near term direction with either a breakout rally or a breakdown and if we get a break down it's almost certainly going to line up with some type of rejection off the 200 day which is actually really not a good sign at all.

With growth to continue through this year as an expansion ramps up in Q2. Gold has also risen an additional $250/oz since.\n\n$72 million x4= $288mil cash flow. Convert to CAD is $412mil. KNT.TO currently has a $2.7 billion market cap. It\u2019s trading at a mere 6x cash flow. This isn\u2019t factoring future production at a now higher gold price, this would add an additional $15mil/quarter cash flow.\n\nI think now that earnings are released and as market processes them KNT will go on a run all week to $13-14 range. IV has dropped and option premiums are dirt cheap. As I write this you can buy ITM $11 calls for $.45, only $0.08 premium. A run to $13 will 4x your money.\n\nMy position is:\n2k shares\n30 calls at $10 March\n10 calls $11 March\n10 calls $12 April",

        "title": "My black swan has her wings - LMT into the toilet make puts go BOOM!",
        "text": "ETA 3/21/25: Ok so I got wildly lucky with the announcement on the NGAD. This wasn't part of my thesis but I'll take the 'bank error in your favor' and I'll even pass Go and collect my $200 on top. I took profits on some of my puts and am going to wait for things to settle out before picking up more. I'll ride the ones I have. I still believe in my thesis and I think that now, with NGAD off the table, any announcements of cancelled F35 orders will have a much bigger impact as LMT is no longer in the running for the replacement which means it needs the long tail of service contracts that Canada and other EU orders would have added onto their order books. I'm still looking for a big drop between now and the post earnings period but at this point I'll be using profits on the play to keep in the game. YMMV\n\nETA: My thesis applies to LMT for the period from 3/17/25 through end of May 2025. More or less an earnings play but I'm not sure if the drop will be before, on or after earnings.\n\nETA: some additional context at the bottom of the post that address legitimate questions that I think I can answer from comments\n\nETA: Updated my position to reflect adding another put option. To me on this day (3/17/2025) the market seems like it wants to keep trading back up to test 5737, maybe as high as 5809, before we see the next leg down. So I will add more as we approach those levels.\n\n\\-------------------------------------\n\nI could write a separate post about why I think we are about to experience a black swan event (or really a black swan period) and I'm not sure if this particular point I am going to discuss will cause it. Either way there is a ton of money to be made on LMT in the next few hours / days / weeks or months.\n\nHard to know exactly when the market will realize just how much POTUS has fucked up LMT's business and then from there I don't know if the market will immediately see the contagion risk for other US defense companies. It may take some time for this to sink in, not sure.\n\nOk so about LMT - Lockheed Martin is a defense contractor. The big thing to know for this is that they make the most expensive and capable fighter aircraft (war plane for shooting down other planes and/or dropping bombs) in the world. There are huge reliability and quality issues but end of the day nothing for sale by any company on the planet can beat it and nations across the globe (Canada, UK, Germany, many other nations across Europe, etc.) have placed orders ranging from a few billion dollars to hundreds of billions for F35 aircraft and after acquisition support and maintenance. The purchase price is roughly **$125,000,000** each (I'm not sure if that includes maintenance and support, I think maybe just support but there would be additional significant amounts of money going to LMT for maintenance over time).\n\nWith hundreds of billions of dollars of orders on the books, many more statements of intent from nations like Portugal, Turkiye, etc. and the associated revenue streams from maintenance, ammunition, etc. LMT has been looking pretty great since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine which sent nations across the globe scrambling to buy the bets military tech they could afford.\n\nBut that brings us to today. Where things are suddenly changing drastically and in ways that are likely not reversible, at least not in any reasonable timeframe. The market hasn't yet priced this in and I don't know exactly when that will happen. Could be during the April earnings release. Could be tomorrow when trading begins. Could be anytime between now and then.\n\nSee the thing is; when you are a nation that has managed to pull together a couple of billion dollars to buy military aircraft that you intend to use for the next 20, 30 maybe even 40 years, you tend to really think through the decision. There are many factors involved; not the least of which is how reliant are you on the manufacturer (and the nation that manufacturer is based in) for support and maintenance.  Obviously if you can bring support and maintenance to your own nation then the dollars spent at least stay in your own country however that isn't always possible, especially with cutting edge top of the line systems, like the F35. Anyone who owns and operates the F35 platform will need unfettered access to LMT resources and specialists in order to get anywhere close to 100% of the benefit you might expect to get from having these in your air force. Just keeping them flying without access to LMT might prove impossible, let alone using all the fancy bells and whistles which in some cases rely on access to US military satellites in orbit.\n\nThe other piece to this puzzle is that these planes take A LONG time to build. Canada ordered 88 planes for about $9,000,000,000 back in 2023 and they are expected to get their first batch of 16 sometime next year. And they have only paid for those first 16 so not much they can do about that. But there are 72 F35 planes at roughly $125,000,000 a pop that they haven't paid for but LMT has in their order books. This is Canada I'm speaking about, the nation that POTUS keeps insisting will become part of the USA (whether they want to or not) and has been using economic extortion to try and extract trade concessions. That already made the idea of buying these additional 72 plans dicey but then you had POTUS suddenly cancel all military maintenance and support contracts between US defense contractors and Ukraine. This was walked back a bit but it made everybody sit up and think about the fact that POTUS was so mercurial that the idea of buying incredibly expensive weapons that could be hobbled on the word of POTUS maybe isn't the best idea.\n\nSince close of market on Friday the following has happened:\n\n1. The nation of Portugal (which had previously said they intended to buy some F35s) has announced they will look for alternatives that are manufactured in Europe. These aren't firm orders but they do represent part of the potential customer based for the F35.\n2. Then Turkiye, who has wanted to purchase the F35 for years and was prevented from doing so due to some geopolitical stuff announced that they would buy 40 fighter aircraft from the UK. Now these planes aren't nearly as good (or expensive as the F35) however the idea that Turkiye would invest what will end up being hundreds of millions of dollars into aircraft that aren't F35s and more importantly aren't from their usual military aircraft supplier (the USA) means that any future plans to purchase the F35 is now in doubt.\n3. Canada has now announced they intend to look for alternatives to the F35 instead of moving forward with the purchase of an additional 72 planes. I don't know if this will mean they are breaking a contract or maybe it is just rescinding a statement of intent. That is a question I don't have the answer to at the moment but it really doesn't matter. These were sales that are currently reflected in the LMT stock price that are now, for all intents and purposes, cancelled.\n\nSo that is my play - I am going to be buying more puts on LMT to add to what I already have over time (current position below)\n\nETA 3/17/25: Picked up June 20th $400P x1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8sccerz7s5pe1.png?width=1229&format=png&auto=webp&s=550517e5f82379d8e6f412d617ccb9a12bd68505\n\nETA: 3/21/25 sold the June $400P and all 5 of the $370P plus 5 of the $330P. The 5 remaining June $330P I'll leave as free runners. I figure we hit a local low. If the stock trades sideways I'll save theta and if it bounces I'll have a buying opportunity for more puts. If it crashes I have those 5 runners. Cheers to all who are following this tiny drama of mine\n\nI was already expecting a complete market crash as a result of POTUS' choices and actions. I've made some nice money in the last three weeks as a result. However I think we are just getting started and SOMETHING is going to lead to a bear market, possibly a depression. This thing with LMT could be the black swan that does it because when the market realizes the above is the reality of the situation there is a logical next thought: what about OTHER platforms and systems, whether made by LMT or other US defense contractors.\n\nBuying Patriot air defense systems or already own some and think you might need to buy some ammunition? Maybe time to look around at diversifying your supplier for anti aircraft and anti missile systems in case POTUS decides he doesn't like you.\n\nWhat about new tanks and armored transports? Probably not the kind of thing that relies as heavily on the manufacturer but spare parts and software updates will still be needed and if you have to switch to another supplier for additional vehicles down the road you will now have multiple platforms in operation which complicates logistics, training and operations, tactical operations, etc. That can impact decision making on new purchases.\n\nNaval vessels? Advanced radar systems to use on the weapons platform (that flies, drives or sails) which you are purchasing from a different manufacturer? These are the most complex technical systems on the planet and often have components from different manufacturers. LMT might make the plane but it uses things made by RTX and other defense companies.\n\nAnd this isn't something that you can easily fix. POTUS can promise to be nice and stay on his best behavior.... which I don't think he would even be willing to say let alone follow through on. But even if he did say it are militaries around the world going to want to have to rely on that? Can they risk having their nation's ability to defend itself hinge on the good will of someone who could favorably be described as inconsistent?\n\nETA: Supporting evidence: \n\nThis is from a member of the Danish legislature https://x.com/RasmusJarlov/status/1902389277423509877\n\nAnd this writeup explains what I'm saying but written by a professional. https://archive.ph/2025.03.11-191538/https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/04/trump-zelensky-vance-ukraine-defense-arms/\n\nI don't know if the collapse of the US defense sector will lead to a complete market crash. But I think it has a chance. Either way I'm confident something will do that and in the mean time LMT puts seem rife with opportunity at the moment.\n\nETA:\n\nThe USA is the biggest customer for the US arms industry, \\~70% of LMT's customers are right here in the USA:\n\nIn terms of my specific DD for this specific arms manufacturer at this specific moment in time - LMT is currently filling orders on what is the most expensive defense production run in human history. It is valued at over a trillion dollars for the life of the platform (from development, through production and to the end of post production support such as spare parts, software updates and maintenance). The vast majority of that mammoth expense was shouldered by the USA and funded design, development and early production. The plan originally was for many additional nations to place orders to meet per unit cost targets. But the system was just too expensive and there was actually a bit of a crisis from the early 2000's up until 2022 because the USA was basically the \\*only\\* customer which meant the entire cost of the project was on the USA. Then Russia invaded Ukraine and started doing war crimes in full view of satellites. Canada who had been on the fence for years suddenly ordered 88. The UK massively upped their order. A bunch of other nations in Europe and beyond placed or expanded orders and the cost per unit has plunged. All to say that the last 10 years have been all USA and the next 10 years were supposed to be mostly Europe, Middle East, South Asia, South East Asia, Australia/NZ, etc.\n\nAlso in general I am very bearish on many industries in the USA including defense\\*\n\n\\* [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/defense-stocks-drop-after-trump-says-defense-spending-could-be-halved.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/defense-stocks-drop-after-trump-says-defense-spending-could-be-halved.html)",

        "title": "The Fed Is in Wait-and-See Mode. Investors Want Reassurance It Will Act If Needed",
        "text": "Jerome Powell faces a tricky task this week of both assuring investors the economy remains on solid footing while also conveying policymakers stand ready to step in if necessary.\n\nEven as the Federal Reserve chair has touted US resilience, uneasiness sparked by President Donald Trump\u2019s rapidly escalating trade war has sent stocks tumbling over the past month. Bond yields are down, too, as is consumer sentiment as worries about the economic outlook mount.\n\n\u201cPowell needs to give some sort of a signal that they\u2019re watching it,\u201d said Dominic Konstam, head of macro strategy at Mizuho Securities USA. While the Fed chief will likely make it clear that officials don\u2019t target the stock market, they can\u2019t ignore the recent slide, he warned.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates steady when they meet March 18-19, but traders now see high odds of three rate cuts this year, most likely beginning in June. Economists generally expect two reductions, similar to what forecasters foresee policymakers\u2019 updated projections to show Wednesday. \n\nSome investors caution that if officials continue to signal only two reductions in 2025, it becomes all the more important for the Fed chief to emphasize the central bank\u2019s willingness to adjust borrowing costs if the labor market stumbles. \n\n\u201cAt the margin, the Fed could make it slightly better or slightly worse,\u201d said James Athey, a portfolio manager at Marlborough Investment Management. \u201cBut clearly they can\u2019t completely calm markets because the hit to sentiment has come largely from the White House.\u201d \n\nOn top of the escalating and ever-changing tariff threats toward America\u2019s largest trading partners, the Trump administration hasn\u2019t done much to downplay recession risks. The president said March 9 that the US economy faces a \u201cperiod of transition,\u201d and his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted the US and markets are in need of a \u201cdetox.\u201d \n\n*Market Reaction*\n\nThe two-year yield, most sensitive to the Fed\u2019s monetary policy, has declined almost 60 basis points from a mid-January peak to a trough this month of 3.83%, the lowest level in over five months. And while stocks advanced on Friday, the move came after a selloff that culminated in a 10% plunge of the S&P 500 from its peak. Wall Street\u2019s so-called fear gauge \u2014 the VIX \u2014 at one point last week climbed to the highest levels since August.\n\nThose market jitters have ramped up the stakes as officials release fresh economic projections that stand to offer insight into how much officials anticipate Trump\u2019s policies will affect the economy. Policymakers are expected to slightly downgrade their forecasts for growth this year and bump up their outlook for so-called core inflation, which excludes food and energy.\n\nBut Powell will likely be reticent to guarantee investors the Fed will spring into action at the first signs of a faltering economy without a key caveat: Officials need to see evidence inflation is sustainably moving toward their 2% goal and that expectations for future price growth remain stable. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll hear the message that things are still holding up, and that policy is in a good place where the Fed can react in either direction \u2014 whether that\u2019s stubbornly high inflation or a more marked slowdown in the economy,\u201d said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo & Co. \u201cNow what I would like to hear more is just getting more clarity on how they are weighing the two sides of their mandate.\u201d\n\nWhile consumer prices rose at a slower pace in February and the producer price index was unchanged from a month earlier, the components that feed into the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 were largely firmer. A closely watched measure of long-term inflation expectations climbed for a third month to a more than three-decade high. \n\nSuch data limits the Fed\u2019s ability to act and bolster the economy until the weakness starts to appear more directly in the labor market, said Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist for Deutsche Bank AG. That could show up in the form of weaker payroll gains, a rise in the unemployment rate or a spike in layoffs, he said. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of uncertainty that\u2019s out there, and it\u2019s possible that that filters into the hard data, but they are going to be in kind of a wait-and-see mode to see whether or not that happens,\u201d said Luzzetti, who does not expect the Fed to lower rates this year. \u201cAt the same time, I think they\u2019re seeing greater evidence that their job on inflation is not done.\u201d\n\nIf the Fed were to confront a weakening economy amid still-elevated inflation, about two-thirds of economists in a Bloomberg survey said they would expect officials to hold borrowing costs steady.\n\nComplicating the outlook is the possibility that other policies proposed by the Trump administration, such as tax cuts and deregulation, could boost the economy and inflation in the months ahead. Powell and his colleagues have emphasized they are watching to see what the \u201cnet effects\u201d of Trump\u2019s policies will be on the economy and want more clarity on the overall impact before adjusting policy. \n\n\u201cDespite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\u201d Powell said earlier this month at an event in New York, his last public remarks before officials gather this week. \u201cWe do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\u201d\n\n*Balance Sheet*\n\nWall Street strategists will also be keen for any hints on the Fed\u2019s plans to pause or further slow the speed at which the central bank is reducing its balance sheet \u2014 a process known as quantitative tightening or QT. Minutes of the January gathering revealed policymakers had discussed the potential need to pause or slow the process until lawmakers can strike a deal over the government\u2019s debt ceiling.\n\n\u201cThe argument for March is that the Fed has already talked about it,\u201d said Blake Gwinn, head of US rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cSo why not just do it \u2014 as they can pause QT and then just restart it later.\u201d\n",

        "text": "I made this write up for a friend who wanted to learn more about trading/investing and how to identify where to put money to work. I figured it could be of use to some of you here who don't already know. \n\n\nFor determining if stocks are in favor over safe haven assets I use\nSPY/GLD \nSPY/TLT\nThese represent the flow of capital and the relative performance of the stock market to gold, and to bonds. When gold and bonds are starting to outperform stocks on a longer time frame like the weekly chart it is a warning sign. And historically the start of a multi year/decade long trend. These things play out over a long time. Which is good because it gives us time to react. The other helpful indicator is XLY/XLP which is consumer discretionary vs consumer staples. Think Amazon, apple, etc. Vs walmart, proctor and gamble, etc. When consumers are tapped and cut back on discretionary spending this ratio chart will show it. Consumers have to still buy staples like food, toilet paper, etc. And so money flows to safety in these stocks as well. (Although they typically only do well for a limited time prior to crashes and don't necessarily rise in market downturns, they just fall less)\n\nFrom here if we determine that safe haven assets are starting to outperform its pretty easy and simple on what to do. Move capital out of stocks and into cash, bonds, and gold. How much into each is discretionary and kinda up to you on how much risk you are willing to take on by holding risk assets vs safe havens.\n\nIf we determine that stocks are in favor over safe havens, typically during the growth phase of the business cycle and after major market/economic corrections and crashes. This happens when liquidity is pumped into the system via central banks printing money and government issuing debt. They do this to stimulate the economy, create inflation and This is the time to take on risk and buy risk assets. Through out the bullmarket you will see different sectors out perform and to identify that I use a couple different ratios.\nI like QQQ/DIA to determine if the market likes growth vs value and\nIWM/SPY to identify market cap outperformance.\n\nAnd then you can go all the way into the nitty gritty of sectors and in any combination you can compare these names to each other or to the broad market via the SPY\n\nXLY(discretionary)\nXLP(staples)\nXLV(healthcare)\nXLF(financials)\nXLU(utilities)\nXLE(energy)\nXLK(tech)\nXLC( communication services)\nXHB(real estate)\n\n\n\n",

            "This is basically the Hot Waitress index described differently.\n\nhttps://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/58195/\n\n>The indicator I prefer is the Hot Waitress Index: The hotter the waitresses, the weaker the economy. In flush times, there is a robust market for hotness. Selling everything from condos to premium vodka is enhanced by proximity to pretty young people (of both sexes) who get paid for providing this service. That leaves more-punishing work, like waiting tables, to those with less striking genetic gifts. But not anymore.\n\n>A waitress at one Lower East Side club described to me what happened there: \u201cThey slowly let the boys go, then the less attractive girls, and then these hot girls appeared out of nowhere. All in the hope of bringing in more business. The managers even admitted it. These hot girls that once thrived on the generosity of their friends in the scene for hookups\u2014hosting events, marketing brands, modeling\u2014are now hunting for work.\u201d A Soho restaurateur I know recently received applications from \u201ca couple of classic Eastern European fembots. Once upon a time, these ladies must\u2019ve made $1,500 a night lap dancing. At my place, they\u2019re not going to make that in a week.\u201d\n\n**more sources:**\n\nhttps://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/hot-waitress-economic-index/\n\nhttps://www.wallstreetmojo.com/hot-waitress-economic-index/",

            "I know someone that has a similar theory he calls the coffee house index. You go into a coffee house and order a complicated drink. If it comes to you swiftly and it is correct, the economy sucks, because the person making your coffee is over qualified, but can't find anything better. If the service is slow and sloppy and your drink sucks, the economy is good because the coffee shop can't get anyone qualified to work for that money.",

Here\u2019s two that I\u2019m long only on*: \n\nRolls Royce has been on a tear for a few years, driven by an impressive turn around, covid recovery and the emerging promise of small modular reactors as a sustainable and affordable solution to the energy crisis. The recent up swing from a defence point of view is relatively small in the grand scheme of things. I can see them climbing much much higher. My personal price target is \u00a312/share. It\u2019s currently circa \u00a38, so 50% upside. \n\nSimilarly, Babcock in the UK have a huge amount of defence exposure and have done well in the recent rally, but are at a modest PE, have also worked to refocus their core business, and stand to do very well wrt any European ground based defence force thanks to their expertise with keeping older armoured and infantry fighting vehicles and suchlike in service. I see this climbing to \u00a310/share. Approx 40% upside. \n\n*UK based regards typically invest personally via ISAs for tax efficiency and so options trading is less common.

I know at least ETRADE restricts trades for 16:00-16:01 - I assumed due to immense closing volume for the entire market.\n\n  \nthat looks like those are 5-minute bars so that's 10mins of heavy selling. curious to see the volume at those times too.  given the sudden light trading I imagine that the order book would have a ton of entries removed causing any \"market\" orders to match at lower prices.  \n\n  \ntracking what's happening around this time is quite difficult - grab a large portion of the order book and timestamp everything as it changes.  filled orders you will see, and you should also see a bunch of entries get removed by the matching engine right at the close.  if you are seeing trades execute , check their time stamp and the timestamp you got things, you may be seeing a race condition on the matching engine... if you do, it's possible to game it by entering buy orders good for the day, and sell orders good for after-hours trading (or inverse it).\n\n\n\nit looks like someone else figured it out too, there are also likely a pile-up of these type of orders which are triggered immediately following the close. something you can play with...",

Although the market was closed that day, on the next trading day, April 17th, SPY went up +0.62%.\n\n**Die Lit** \\- May 11th, 2018\n\nHis next album was released on May 11th, 2018. The following trading session netted a +0.25% gain for SPY.\n\n**Whole Lotta Red** \\- December 25th, 2020\n\nReleased on Christmas Day, on the following trading session SPY went up again at a +0.12% gain. But when we compare it to the previous close, it gained +0.86%.\n\n**Music** \\- March 14th, 2025\n\nToday, Playboi Carti released his newest album and the stock market response is clear. At the time of writing, SPY is up almost +2% with 1 hour to go until close. Clearly, the market rises every time Playboi Carti drops an album and this would explain the rise today.\n\n  \nTrump? Tarrifs? Trade wars? Nah, it's only carti.\n\n",

            "\u201cThe new deal could also mean a windfall for Ukraine. Under the plan, defense spending exceeding 1 percent of gross domestic product will be exempted from the strictures of the country\u2019s strict debt brake, which drastically limits the structural budget deficit. But under the latest draft, that exemption also now includes aid for countries unlawfully attacked under international law \u2014 one of the key demands of the Greens.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat means, assuming the plan passes through parliament as now expected, Germany will be able to provide many billions in aid to Ukraine through borrowing. Spending to counteract cyber threats as well as intelligence services will also be included under the debt-brake exemption, said Merz.\u201c\n\nKeep pumping those EU Defense stocks!",

            "I've been to a dollar general exactly one time in my life and that was within the last month. The only reason I went was because it was close and I could expense what I was buying. I have no idea why anyone actually shops there enough to be a regular customer. Everything is extremely expensive for the quantity and the stores are shitholes. Is it just a store that survives on people being absolutely shit at simple math?",
            "Aren't the dollar store consumers always strapped for cash? I thought catering to cash strapped customers was their business model. DG and DLTR stock prices are where they were 10 yrs ago, their problems are multifold - stores that look like hurricanes pass through them routinely, rampant thefts because there is never enough staff, price for subpar products that doesn't make sense when Walmart, Aldi and others sell for cheaper when adjusted to quantity to name a few. Its almost like the only reason they are still in business is because no big box retailer will open a store in rural America.",

ARE.  DEAD. \n\nWe went from doing 200+ car deals weekly with each deal producing thousands of dollars in down payment\u2026. To doing 80 cars in a week with minimal down, IF we\u2019re lucky. \n\nThis economy is going to crash. Position yourselves accordingly.",
            "Another reason why i say that the bullshit bubble in tech must burst.  \nPeople simply don't have money for dicking around with shit like Bitcoin or vaporwar from Tesler.\n\nSo, if you would pretty please short the shit out of TSLA and MSTR and help the world move on and invest in things that make sense?\n\nPreparing civilization to expand into space is something that can be done, but must mean to increase production, automate as much work as possible and start building an exostructure for earth, i.e., the damn space elevator.\n\nAs of right now, the most profitable expansion in production is probably water irrigation to regreen deserts, particularly in africa.   \nPlant a fucking seed and let the plant do the production for you.\n\nShit like that can all be done and everyone on the planet gets rich in the process. Musks 'vision' of just sending over rockets to Mars is regarded. Why is no one saying anything?",
            "Dollar General, Five Below, Dollar Tree, etc. all pay $10.00 an hour.\n\nI heard working there is hell and you\u2019re usually the only one working.

Even though it was, in general, always on the decline over a longer period of time, it would seem to regularly swing between high and low points that were pretty generously far away from each other. So even though it was trending downward, day to day, the same price point(s) would be met again, and again, and again, to where I had a pretty high level of confidence as far as where it might bottom out, and where it might top out at. It was always a moving target, but it was something I could feel pretty confident about. Back then I didn't have the confidence to buy shares directly, so I used to just sell put options when it was at a low point, being very, very certain that it wouldn't end up going far enough below that floor (say if something unexpected happened) to eat through the premium of the put options I was selling. I would just sell them on 30-ish day expiration dates, and then wait for the stock price to go back up like it always seemed to do, and buy-to-close my contracts early if the profit was good enough.\n\nThere were some moments that freaked me out where things looked very bad, for instance, whenever orange man would make some comments on twitter that would spook the market (I'm not getting political on that, there were very specific moments where things he said did impact the price of things on the market temporarily, regardless of whether i'm for or against him), so there were some moments where I thought I was going to lose a lot, but overall things worked out in the end. At some point I stopped trading and went back to a normal day job, because prices in my local area have gone up so much that I can't pay the bills just trading anyways and I was getting stressed over depending on it for an income.\n\nThat pattern that I had seen originally does not seem to hold true very recently, but still. I like the stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l9c1bftchioe1.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=359c3c33857c4f03c4ffe92827a8e3f62407efd5\n\n**Edit**: Oh, also, this specific stock, had a low enough price point that made it attractive for me to sell options contracts without needing an outrageous balance to cover them, while still having room for selling put options on the next lower price increment, with that increment being a price point that the stock might reasonably drop to (so there was a reasonable price assigned to that contract)",

They change their licensing and pricing model so fast that the sales people don\u2019t even know what is going on half the time. \n\nTheir cloud AI products aren\u2019t exactly new. They have had the same technology for years in their on prem solutions, and they were terrible. Hard to use, did not produce results, and some were even decommissioned completely in favor of the cloud alternatives. It feels like you are being forced to their cloud solution, and in order to take advantage of what they are selling you, you have to fully utilize the suite from idea inception to deployment. \n\nI can go on and on about this company lol. The RPA solution is great, but they are open about ditching that for AI. Which was clunky and slow when we tried it. It was easier to just sit a person down for 2 hours with the person their robot was supposed to monitor, instead of waiting the 2-4 weeks for the robot to tell me the same information in a less digestible way.

For the case of this write up, I will mostly be focused on hotel, restaurant, and airline industries, since these industries are closely correlated and are considered elastic goods. Moreover, tourism to the United States, which is a key revenue source for these industries, will likely be down going forward due to rises in foreign tensions. Many Canadians are already talking about cancelling and boycotting travel to the United States, so these industries will feel the repercussions in the following months/years.\n\nAirlines: \nDelta: -30% in the past month\nUnited Airlines: -28% in the past month\nAmerican Airlines: -30% in the past month\n\nRestaurants/Food:\nSbux: -12.7% in the past month\nCava: -37% in the past month\nWingstop: -30% in the past month\nChipotle: -14% in the past month\n\nHotels:\nHyatt: -15.33% in the past month\nMariott: -15.4% in the past month\nHilton: -15.26% in the past month\n\n$DRI has not yet taken a hit from the recent economic turmoil, only dropping 5% in the past month. Due to the target audience of its restaurants, I believe that they are more susceptible to the affects of a recession than fast food restaurants such as Wingstop, Chipotle, and Cava, which have seen significant dips recently. \n\nRestaurants like Olive Garden and Longhorse steakhouse are treated as a night out for lower class/lower middle class Americans, and will be among the first expenses to be cut when their budgets inevitably tighten. I believe in the case of a recession, more Americans will ditch restaurants like Olive Garden and Longhorse steakhouse than Chipotle, Wingstop, and Cava.\n\nFor reference here is how $DRI performed during the past recessions/pullbacks\n\n2008: -68.5% decrease\n2020: -63% decrease\n2022: -25% decrease\n\nI believe $DRI has much room to fall over the next year and maybe even longer.\n",

        "text": "Shares of Intel Corp. jumped the most in five years after the company named Lip-Bu Tan as its next chief executive officer. \n\nThe announcement stoked optimism from investors, who sent the stock up as much as 19% after markets opened in New York on Thursday, its biggest intraday gain since March 2020. [But remains at 2009 levels.]\n\nTan, 65, will assume the role on March 18, the company said in a statement Wednesday. He will rejoin the board as well after stepping down in August 2024. [\u2026] [Intel is] entrusting a former board member and semiconductor veteran with one of the toughest jobs in the chip industry. \n\nTan, the former head of Cadence Design Systems Inc., is tasked with restoring the fortunes of a pioneering chipmaker that\u2019s become an industry laggard. Intel, which dominated the semiconductor field for decades, is struggling with market-share losses, manufacturing setbacks and a precipitous decline in its earnings. It\u2019s also burdened with debt and recently had to slash about 15,000 jobs.\n\nBank of America Corp. analysts also upgraded the shares to \u201cneutral\u201d after the announcement, citing Tan\u2019s \u201csolid track record.\u201d Prior to Wednesday\u2019s announcement, the stock had declined more than 50% over the past 12 months as the company\u2019s future became increasingly murky.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say it will be easy. It won\u2019t be,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am joining because I believe with every fiber of my being that we have what it takes to win. Intel plays an essential role in the technology ecosystem, both in the US and around the world.\u201d\n\nTan\u2019s predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was pushed out by the board for a perceived failure to rejuvenate Intel\u2019s product lineup. One of the most glaring challenges: creating an artificial intelligence accelerator chip that can rival the products of Nvidia Corp. That company, once in Intel\u2019s shadow, has seen its revenue and valuation skyrocket over the past two years due to the AI computing boom.\n\nIntel remains one of the world\u2019s biggest chipmakers by revenue, with more than $50 billion in annual sales. Its processors are the main component in more than 70% of the world\u2019s personal computers and server machines. And the company\u2019s factories still represent a large chunk of worldwide capacity for advanced manufacturing.\n\nIn 2024, Intel was by far the lowest performer on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, declining 60%. As the company\u2019s valuation plummeted back to 1990s levels, the once-unthinkable idea of an Intel takeover has become more plausible.\n",

        "title": "DD: Most Undervalued Mid-Cap (CORZ) (very long and detailed analysis)",
        "text": "TL;DR: Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) is wildly undervalued and the market is sleeping on it. This company has transformed from a troubled Bitcoin miner into a data center powerhouse riding the AI wave \u2013 and it\u2019s already generating serious revenue. With a massive $12B OpenAI deal validating its strategy (through partner CoreWeave), a high-margin, long-term AI hosting contract kicking in, and Wall Street still pricing it like a simple crypto miner, CORZ presents a high-upside, strong conviction play. I hold 5,000 shares and couldn\u2019t be more confident. Below I\u2019ll break down why I believe CORZ can rip higher in the short, medium, and long term \u2013 with price targets of $12 (short-term), $20 (medium-term), and $30+ (long-term) \u2013 based on hard data and catalysts the market is blatantly overlooking.\n\nFrom Bitcoin Miner to AI Data Center Leader\n\nCore Scientific operates large-scale data centers (like its Denton, TX facility pictured above) that were originally built for Bitcoin mining \u2013 and it\u2019s now repurposing this infrastructure to power the AI revolution.\n\nJust a year ago, Core Scientific was known primarily as one of North America\u2019s largest Bitcoin miners. It mined a record 13,762 BTC in 2023 \u2013 more than any other publicly traded miner \ufffc. But after navigating a tough crypto bear market and slashing $400M of debt in bankruptcy restructuring (saving ~$60M in interest costs annually \ufffc), CORZ emerged in 2024 with a new lease on life and a new mission. Management recognized the huge opportunity in AI and high-performance computing (HPC), and they\u2019ve struck a game-changing deal to pivot into that space \ufffc \ufffc.\n\nToday, Core Scientific isn\u2019t just a crypto play \u2013 it\u2019s fast becoming a major data center player for AI. In June 2024, the company inked a transformative 12-year contract to provide ~200 megawatts (MW) of its data center capacity to CoreWeave, the AI cloud provider \ufffc. Under this deal, CORZ will host CoreWeave\u2019s cutting-edge NVIDIA GPU rigs in its facilities, effectively turning its mining centers into AI supercomputing hubs. The site modifications are already underway and expected to be operational by mid-2025 \ufffc. This is a big deal \u2013 literally. Once fully up and running, that initial contract is estimated to generate **over $3.5 billion in revenue for Core Scientific over 12 years (about $290M per year) \ufffc. Even better, the hosting revenues come with approx. 75\u201380% gross margins \ufffc, far more predictable and stable than volatile Bitcoin mining profits. In other words, CORZ is locking in a decade of high-margin, recurring cash flow from the AI boom.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the beginning. CoreWeave was so satisfied that it exercised an option for an extra 70 MW within weeks \ufffc, expanding the partnership. This adds another ~$1.2B in contracted revenue (bringing total HPC contract value to ~$4.7B!) \ufffc \ufffc. All told, CORZ now has ~500 MW of its capacity contracted for AI/HPC through CoreWeave between 2025\u20132026 \ufffc \ufffc. For context, that is massive scale \u2013 comparable to or bigger than many established data center operators. In fact, with 1.2 GW (1,200 MW) of total power capacity across its sites, Core Scientific is positioned to be one of the largest data center operators in the U.S. \ufffc \ufffc. Roughly 70% of its infrastructure is now earmarked for AI/HPC hosting versus 30% for Bitcoin, yet the stock still isn\u2019t being valued like a data center company \ufffc. This disconnect is our opportunity.\n\nFuture Profitability & Growth Trajectory \ud83d\ude80\n\nThe growth trajectory here is off the charts. Core Scientific\u2019s legacy mining business is already cash-generative (especially with Bitcoin rebounding \u2013 BTC has climbed from ~$17k at end of 2022 to ~$43k by end of 2023 \ufffc, greatly improving mining economics). CORZ continues to mine ~16\u201319 BTC per day from its own fleet \ufffc \ufffc, and it\u2019s deploying next-gen miners to boost efficiency. But the real game-changer is the HPC hosting side coming online:\n\t\u2022\tStable High-Margin Revenue: Starting in 2025, Core Scientific will begin raking in ~$290M/year in AI hosting revenue from the CoreWeave contract \ufffc. Unlike mining, this is dollar-denominated, fixed-fee revenue \u2013 not subject to coin price swings. Gross margins are expected to be 75\u201380% \ufffc, which will supercharge profitability. Essentially, CORZ is becoming a hybrid of a crypto miner and a high-margin data center REIT.\n\t\u2022\tPredictable Cash Flow: Management highlighted that AI hosting provides a level of predictability that mining lacks \ufffc. Power costs and BTC prices can whipsaw mining profits, but the HPC contracts lock in client payments and even have the client (CoreWeave) funding much of the build-out capex \ufffc. This dramatically de-risks the business model going forward. We\u2019re talking recurring revenue for 12+ years from Tier-1 AI clients.\n\t\u2022\tExpansion and Upside: Core Scientific isn\u2019t stopping at 270 MW for CoreWeave. They have ~130+ MW of additional capacity ready to contract with other AI customers \ufffc \ufffc. Management explicitly said they are in discussions with other potential HPC clients to capitalize on their \u201csignificant pipeline of powered real estate\u201d \ufffc. The demand is there \u2013 in fact, analysts at the recent investor day swarmed them with questions about the AI contracts, not mining \ufffc, showing where the future lies. Any new contracts (think other cloud providers, government, universities, etc.) would be gravy on top of the CoreWeave deal. There\u2019s room to easily sign hundreds more MW in the coming years, given their planned expansions in Oklahoma, Georgia, Alabama and more.\n\t\u2022\tOperating Leverage: With debt reduced and interest costs down, plus legacy infrastructure already in place, much of the new revenue will drop to the bottom line. Even before the AI pivot, CORZ was delivering positive adjusted EBITDA. Now, factor in $300M+ of high-margin annual AI revenue, plus a potential Bitcoin bull cycle (post-2024 halving and potential ETF approvals) boosting mining profits\u2026 you get the picture. This company could be printing cash in 2025 and beyond. Bernstein analysts actually project CORZ turning net-profitable in 2025 as the AI hosting ramps up \ufffc. The \u201ccrypto miner that went bankrupt\u201d narrative is outdated \u2013 Core Scientific is now a cash flow machine in the making.\n\nBottom line: The growth trajectory is dual-powered \u2013 steady AI hosting revenue growth and optionality on Bitcoin\u2019s upside. If BTC runs again (many expect a major move in the next 1-2 years due to the halving and institutional adoption), CORZ\u2019s mining division (still one of the largest with ~19.4 EH/s hashpower \ufffc \ufffc) will mint money. If BTC stagnates, CORZ still wins big from AI. This balanced model means multiple shots on goal for explosive growth. It\u2019s hard to find a company with this kind of asymmetric upside already trading at a single-digit stock price.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s $12B Deal Validates CORZ\u2019s Long-Term Vision\n\nOne of the strongest confirmations of Core Scientific\u2019s strategy came just this week: OpenAI signed a $12 billion, five-year deal with CoreWeave \ufffc. Yes, the same CoreWeave that partnered with CORZ. This is huge news for the AI infrastructure space and hugely bullish for Core Scientific by association.\n\nWhy? OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) is essentially saying they need massive GPU cloud capacity outside of Microsoft. CoreWeave, which specializes in GPU hosting, is now on the hook to deliver a ton of AI compute to OpenAI \ufffc. We\u2019re talking about potentially building out one of the world\u2019s largest AI supercomputing footprints. And guess who is a key supplier of that footprint? Core Scientific.\n\nCoreWeave has contracted 500 MW of Core Scientific\u2019s data centers to meet its clients\u2019 AI needs \ufffc. The OpenAI deal alone will likely soak up every bit of that and more, meaning CoreWeave may need to exercise further expansion options with CORZ or invest in new sites (likely both). It underscores that demand for AI data center capacity is practically insatiable right now. In 2024, CoreWeave\u2019s revenue exploded 8\u00d7 from $229M to $1.9 billion thanks largely to AI deals with customers like Microsoft \ufffc. Now with OpenAI\u2019s multi-year $12B commitment, CoreWeave\u2019s revenue will go parabolic \u2013 and Core Scientific is integral to supplying that growth \ufffc.\n\nTo put it simply: the AI gold rush is on, and CORZ is selling the shovels (power + space). The OpenAI-CoreWeave partnership de-risks Core Scientific\u2019s long-term prospects even further. It\u2019s tangible proof that AI compute is the future, and CORZ\u2019s massive power infrastructure is exactly what\u2019s needed to capitalize on it. Every major AI player will be scrambling for data center capacity. Core Scientific has some of the largest ready-to-go sites in North America \u2013 a fact not lost on those in the know. (Remember, CoreWeave even tried to acquire Core Scientific for $5.75/share in cash \ufffc last year, and was flatly rejected as \u201cundervalued\u201d \u2013 more on that below.)\n\nOh, and about Microsoft \u2013 there was a fear floating around that Microsoft might back away from using CoreWeave (which could have indirectly hurt CORZ). That rumor was put to rest decisively. CoreWeave denied any contract cancellations with Microsoft and called such reports \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d \ufffc. In fact, Microsoft has massive multi-year plans with CoreWeave (reportedly intending to spend $10B+ on CoreWeave\u2019s services by 2030) \ufffc. So the largest customer relationships are intact, and now OpenAI is piling on with its own gargantuan deal. In short, the HPC side of CORZ\u2019s business is rock-solid and about to experience torrid growth on the back of these AI mega-deals.\n\nMarket Misperception: Not Just a \u201cMining Company\u201d Anymore\n\nDespite everything outlined above, many investors still think of Core Scientific as a Bitcoin mining stock. Old habits die hard \u2013 and that\u2019s why this opportunity exists. The stock came out of bankruptcy in January and was re-listed at just a few bucks, and many probably wrote it off as \u201canother crypto casualty.\u201d The reality couldn\u2019t be more different now. CORZ is morphing into a hybrid AI infrastructure play, but the market hasn\u2019t caught up to this narrative yet.\n\nHere\u2019s the misperception: \u201cIt\u2019s a miner, so it should trade at mining valuations.\u201d Many mining companies trade at low multiples because of volatile earnings and past boom-bust cycles. Core Scientific, however, now has much more in common with data center operators like Equinix (EQIX) or Digital Realty (DLR) than with pure miners. Don\u2019t take my word for it \u2013 Bernstein\u2019s tech analyst Gautam Chhugani explicitly notes that CORZ\u2019s valuation today \u201caligns more closely with Bitcoin mining rather than data center valuations, [even though] 70% of its capacity is dedicated to AI.\u201d \ufffc In other words, Wall Street is pricing CORZ all wrong. The company is being valued like a shrinking, risky crypto miner when in fact it\u2019s a growing, diversified digital infrastructure firm with both crypto and AI tailwinds.\n\nConsider this: Core Scientific will have 800+ MW in HPC data centers and ~400 MW in mining. Equinix, the king of data centers, operates ~240 data centers globally, but their total power capacity is on the order of only a few hundred MW in many markets. Digital Realty similarly has a large footprint but trades at 20+ times FFO (funds from operations) because of its stable data center income. Core Scientific\u2019s HPC contracts are bringing in exactly that kind of stable income, yet CORZ trades at a tiny fraction of the valuation metrics of EQIX/DLR. It\u2019s like buying a data center stock for the price of a distressed crypto stock \u2013 a total disconnect.\n\nLet\u2019s put some numbers on it: At around ~$8\u20139 per share (as of this week), CORZ\u2019s market cap is roughly $4.5 billion (the market hasn\u2019t updated fully to the growth story) \ufffc. For that price, you\u2019re getting 1.2 GW of capacity, $4.7B in contracted AI revenue over the next decade, plus the largest Bitcoin mining operation in North America (which mined 6,300+ BTC in 2024) \ufffc. By contrast, DLR\u2019s market cap is around $30B and Equinix\u2019s is around $70B \u2013 and neither of them has a call option on Bitcoin reaching six figures \ud83d\ude09.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying CORZ should be worth $30B today, but it absolutely deserves a major re-rating as it proves out this HPC pivot. The company itself recognized the undervaluation: remember, when CoreWeave offered $5.75/share cash for the company last summer, the board rejected it for undervaluing CORZ \ufffc. That was when Bitcoin was lower and before the $12B OpenAI deal even existed \u2013 so imagine how much more they\u2019d scoff at $5.75 now. Insiders clearly believe the company is worth a lot more, and so do I.\n\nEvery earnings report and press release going forward is likely to shift the narrative and wake more investors up. Already, research analysts are taking note. Besides Bernstein (Buy, $17 PT), KBW initiated coverage with a Buy and a $22 target \ufffc. The language from these analysts is telling \u2013 they highlight CORZ\u2019s \u201cstrategic partnerships with cloud players like CoreWeave\u201d and its ability to deploy hybrid AI/Bitcoin data centers quickly as key reasons it\u2019s \u201cwell-placed to capitalize\u201d on the AI boom \ufffc. This is strong validation that smart money sees the shift. As these data points permeate and the company delivers actual results (e.g., later in 2025 when the AI revenue hits the income statement in a big way), I expect a cascade of revaluation.\n\nIn summary, the market\u2019s old perception = \u201cCORZ is a bankrupt miner, avoid.\u201d The new reality = \u201cCORZ is a profitable digital infrastructure company with huge AI contracts and a Bitcoin kicker.\u201d We are still closer to the former in terms of stock price, which is exactly why this is the most undervalued future bet I see right now. The market is asleep at the wheel, and we plan to wake up smiling.\n\nUndervaluation Relative to Peers (EQIX, DLR) \u2013 By the Numbers\n\nTo really drive home how mispriced CORZ is, let\u2019s do a quick peer comparison. Equinix and Digital Realty are the blue chips of data centers \u2013 known for steady earnings, high occupancy, etc. Investors pay a premium for that stability. Equinix (EQIX) trades around ~25x EV/EBITDA and ~8x sales. Digital Realty (DLR) trades ~20x EV/EBITDA. Both have dividend yields under 3% \u2013 meaning investors accept low yields because they trust the long-term demand for data centers. These companies also grow in single-digit percentages per year (organically), with big capex needs to add capacity.\n\nNow look at Core Scientific: In 2024, even without the full HPC ramp, it pulled in about ~$100M per quarter in revenue from mining \ufffc (so ~$400M annual run-rate). Add $290M/yr from the first HPC phase starting 2025 \ufffc, and we get ~$700M annual revenue potential. If Bitcoin prices rise, mining revenue could easily push that over $1 billion. So let\u2019s ballpark $1B+ revenue in 2025-26. At the current ~$4.5B market cap, that\u2019s roughly 4.5\u00d7 P/Sales. Equinix by contrast trades at ~10\u00d7 sales. Even if we haircut for the mining portion\u2019s volatility, CORZ\u2019s AI hosting portion alone arguably deserves a similar multiple to data center peers once it\u2019s fully online (given 12-year contracts = very \u201cREIT-like\u201d revenue). On $300M of high-quality AI revenue, a 10\u00d7 multiple would value that segment at $3B. The mining segment, at 6,000+ BTC/year production (which at $50k BTC would be $300M revenue), could also be worth a few billion easily in a bull case. Sum-of-parts, it\u2019s not hard to envision $6B\u2013$8B+ valuation in the near future, which translates to stock price in the mid to high teens. And that doesn\u2019t account for further AI contracts or Bitcoin reaching new highs, which could push numbers even higher.\n\nAnother way to look at it: Enterprise Value per MW of data center capacity. Data centers often change hands at around $10M+ per MW (depending on location and clients). Core Scientific at $4.5B EV for 1,200 MW is only about $3.75M per MW \u2013 dirt cheap. If you value the 800 MW of AI capacity at, say, $8M/MW (still a discount to typical hyperscale DC deals, considering these are cutting-edge GPU facilities), that\u2019s $6.4B right there. Add some value for the 400 MW mining capacity (which isn\u2019t worthless \u2013 it produces BTC and can be repurposed if needed), and you easily justify $8B\u2013$10B EV. That would put the stock roughly in the $20s. It\u2019s not pie-in-the-sky; it\u2019s just basic sum-of-parts with reasonable peer comps.\n\nFinally, remember that Core Scientific\u2019s management already turned down a full cash buyout at $5.75 because they believed it wasn\u2019t fair value \ufffc. They had much more insight into their pipeline and prospects (and boy, were they right \u2013 since then we\u2019ve seen the AI pipeline explode). Insiders are aligned with us in wanting a MUCH higher price. As an investor, that refusal of a buyout is incredibly bullish \u2013 it tells me management genuinely thinks the stock is worth multiples of that offer.\n\nKey Catalysts Ahead\n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201csit and wait for years\u201d story \u2013 I see multiple near-term and medium-term catalysts that could rerate CORZ significantly. Here are the key ones to watch:\n\t\u2022\tHPC Go-Live (Mid-2025): In the next few months, Core Scientific will be completing the modifications and powering up that first 200 MW for CoreWeave\u2019s AI workloads \ufffc. When that goes live (anticipated H1 2025), CORZ can start recognizing the hosting revenue. We might get updates or even initial revenue in Q3 2025 results. The market often prices things in early, so as this milestone nears, expect increasing buzz around CORZ as an \u201cAI infrastructure play\u201d. There may also be ribbon-cutting PR events (like the one in Muskogee, OK for a new 100 MW center \ufffc \ufffc) to draw investor attention.\n\t\u2022\tNew HPC Contracts: Management has hinted at discussions with additional AI/cloud clients \ufffc. Any announcement of a new contract (e.g., leasing another 100+ MW to a different hyperscaler or government project) would be a huge catalyst. It would prove CoreWeave isn\u2019t the only one knocking on the door. Keep an eye on press releases \u2013 CORZ has been expanding into new regions (recently Auburn, Alabama facility announced in Feb 2025 \ufffc \ufffc) specifically to support more HPC customers. We could wake up to a headline like \u201cCore Scientific signs $X billion contract with [Big Tech or Government] for AI data center capacity\u201d \u2013 and the stock would likely gap up on that.\n\t\u2022\tBitcoin Halving & ETF Mania: The Bitcoin halving in April 2024 cut block rewards in half, which historically precedes big BTC bull runs in the subsequent year or two. We\u2019re now post-halving, and there\u2019s a strong narrative for a 2025 crypto upcycle (potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by BlackRock or others, increased mainstream adoption, etc.). If Bitcoin\u2019s price surges, Core Scientific\u2019s mining profitability will skyrocket (since they are highly leveraged to BTC price, mining 16+ BTC daily). Even a move back to Bitcoin\u2019s prior highs ($60k\u2013$65k) would more than double mining revenue from current levels. That would provide upside surprise in earnings and further cash to invest in expansions or pay down any remaining debt. In short, a crypto bull run would be icing on the cake \u2013 not required for our thesis, but it could send the stock into an even higher gear.\n\t\u2022\tCoreWeave IPO: CoreWeave filed for an IPO in March 2025 \ufffc. When that IPO happens, it will likely shine a big spotlight on the value of AI infrastructure companies. If CoreWeave comes out with a huge valuation (some speculate tens of billions given the OpenAI deal and revenue trajectory), people will do the math and realize \u201chey, a big chunk of CoreWeave\u2019s infrastructure is actually provided by Core Scientific.\u201d Investors might look for a cheaper proxy \u2013 and CORZ fits the bill perfectly. Essentially, CORZ could get a sympathy re-rating when CoreWeave IPOs, as a way to play the AI data center theme without paying an IPO premium.\n\t\u2022\tEarnings Surprises / Guidance: As soon as CORZ\u2019s management starts giving forward guidance that includes the HPC contracts, analysts will need to update their models upward. We could see this in late 2024 or early 2025 earnings calls, where they might guide for hundreds of millions in hosting revenue in 2025/26. Any hint of raising forecasts will make the stock pop. Additionally, if their monthly operational updates (which currently report BTC mined, etc.) start to include HPC metrics, that will educate the market. They already mention that they are converting a significant portion of data centers to AI workloads \ufffc \u2013 soon we\u2019ll see actual numbers to attach to that.\n\t\u2022\tIndex Inclusion & Institutional Buying: Having emerged from bankruptcy and re-listed on Nasdaq, CORZ can now be included in indices again. It may also graduate from being seen as \u201cdistressed\u201d to being a legitimate growth stock. As fundamentals improve, more institutions will be able to buy in (some couldn\u2019t touch it during bankruptcy or OTC trading). We might also see hedge funds and big-name investors take positions once they recognize the turnaround. Any such filings or mentions (e.g., a famous value investor or tech fund taking a stake) would be a catalyst.\n\nIn short, there is no shortage of catalysts. This isn\u2019t some cigar-butt value trap \u2013 it\u2019s a dynamic situation with news flow likely skewed to the positive for quite some time. Wall Street is behind the curve, and each catalyst is an alarm clock ringing to wake them up.\n\nStrong Conviction: My Price Targets (Short, Medium, Long Term)\n\nI\u2019ve laid out the facts and the thesis \u2013 now let\u2019s talk price targets and upside. As mentioned, I\u2019m holding 5,000 shares of CORZ and I intend to hold (if not add) because I see massive upside from current levels. Here\u2019s where I realistically see the stock going:\n\t\u2022\tShort Term (next 3\u20136 months): $12+ \u2013 In the short run, I expect CORZ to trade into the double digits as the market starts pricing in the HPC contract ramp and the AI news flow. Recall that management already said $5.75 was too low \ufffc; we\u2019re now well above that, but still in single digits. I think $10\u2013$12 is very achievable on just a bit more recognition, which would still only be ~5x sales and a discount to peers. Short-term catalysts like continued strong Bitcoin production (they mined 471 BTC just in the first two months of 2025 \ufffc) and any hints of additional AI deals could push us to this range quickly. In my view, the downside is pretty limited now that the company is out of bankruptcy and cash-flow positive, so risk/reward is skewed to the upside. Near-term target: $12.\n\t\u2022\tMedium Term (12\u201318 months): $18\u2013$20 \u2013 Over the next year or so (by end of 2025), I see CORZ in the high teens at least. This coincides with the period when the CoreWeave contract will be fully operational and printing revenue. Bernstein\u2019s official target is $17 \ufffc, and KBW\u2019s is $22 \ufffc; my own model splits the difference. By 2025, the company should be solidly profitable, with perhaps $300M+ annual EBITDA (my rough estimate combining mining + hosting). Slapping even a 10\u00d7 EBITDA multiple would give ~$3B enterprise value, and I suspect CORZ will command higher given growth rates \u2013 hence a stock around $18\u201320 makes sense. This also assumes Bitcoin maybe in the $40k\u2013$50k range (conservative) and no major new HPC contracts beyond what\u2019s announced (also conservative). Any positive surprise (e.g., BTC at $70k or another 100MW contract) and we could easily break $20. 12\u201318 month target: ~$20.\n\t\u2022\tLong Term (2\u20133 years+): $30+ (multi-bagger) \u2013 Looking out a few years, I believe CORZ can trade north of $30, making it a potential multi-bagger from here. By that time (2026\u20132027), Core Scientific could have several AI clients, 800+ MW of AI load generating perhaps $600M+/yr in revenue, and still mining a significant amount of Bitcoin with next-next-gen ASICs (they are already planning 2025 miner refresh with 3nm chips \ufffc). If Bitcoin hits new all-time highs in that timeframe (which I personally expect), the mining side alone could be worth the current market cap (!). Meanwhile, the data center side would be maturing into a full-fledged co-location giant. It\u2019s not crazy to think CORZ could approach a $10B+ valuation if all cylinders fire \u2013 which would put the stock roughly in the $30s. Consider that the company nearly sold for ~$6B ($5.75/share) when it was in bankruptcy distress; with a stronger balance sheet and booming business, $30 (equating to maybe ~$15B if dilution is minimal) is a reasonable long-term aspiration. And if we dream a bit: should CORZ eventually spin off its AI data center arm as a REIT or get acquired by a big player, we could see even more upside. But I\u2019ll stay grounded and stick to $30+ as my long-term base case. That\u2019s roughly a triple from here \u2013 exactly the kind of asymmetrical upside that deep due diligence can uncover.\n\nConclusion: High-Upside, Well-Researched, and the Market is Asleep\n\nTo wrap up, Core Scientific is, in my opinion, the most undervalued \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d play on both AI and crypto out there. The company has already proven resilient \u2013 surviving a brutal downturn, emerging stronger, and immediately seizing one of the biggest opportunities of our era (AI compute). They are already profitable on an operating basis, have secured billions in future revenues, and still retain the explosive upside of Bitcoin mining. Yet, because it\u2019s a former bankrupt crypto name, most investors haven\u2019t caught on to the transformation. This is the kind of setup deep-value and growth investors dream about: a misunderstood stock with improving fundamentals and multiple catalysts on deck.\n\nI\u2019m pounding the table with strong conviction on CORZ. I\u2019ve put my money where my mouth is (5,000 shares and holding) because I see what others are missing. If you believe in the future of AI (and the infrastructure needed to run it) and you believe in the long-term value of Bitcoin, this is a no-brainer combination play. Even if you\u2019re only bullish on one of those, CORZ offers a compelling risk-reward skew.\n\nThe market is clearly sleeping on this opportunity, but it won\u2019t stay asleep forever. The facts are coming out quarter by quarter, contract by contract. In my view, it\u2019s only a matter of time before Core Scientific is re-rated from \u201cex-miner penny stock\u201d to \u201cpremier digital infrastructure growth stock.\u201d By then, the easy money will have been made. That\u2019s why the time to get in is now, while it\u2019s undervalued and before the broader market wakes up.\n\nDisclosure: I am long CORZ (5,000 shares) and have no plans to sell in the foreseeable future. I wrote this DD because I believe in the thesis and want to share the research \u2013 but of course, do your own due diligence. This is not financial advice, just one highly confident investor\u2019s perspective. I welcome any counterpoints or additional insights.\n",

As of this writing S&P is up by 0.8%. \n\nThere is a strong argument that the slower month-on-month CPI increase is due to weak consumer demand. Look at the breakdown of the categories.\n\nAirline fares and gasoline prices dropped by 4.0% and 1.0% respectively. This suggests weaker consumer demand for travel.\n\nNew vehicle prices declined by 0.1%. This indicates consumers are holding back on large discretionary purchases. This also aligns with the consumer confidence index from a couple of weeks back which highlighted a drop in sentiment on large purchases in the near future by consumers\n\nOverall the CPI and core CPI numbers reinforce my opinion that the economy is not doing well. Consumers are pulling back and businesses do not feel confident raising prices any more. This will reflect in the next set of readings - both inflation and labor market. I am not buying more stocks based off this report.",

        "text": "*1. Smoot-Hawley Tariffs (USA, 1930-1934)*\n**Effects:** Deepened the Great Depression by triggering international retaliation. U.S. trade collapsed by over 60%. Consumers faced higher prices while farmers lost export markets. Contributed to bank failures and prolonged economic suffering until reversed by the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.\n\n*2. Import Substitution Industrialization (Latin America, 1950s-1970s)*\n**Effects:** Initially created manufacturing jobs and reduced import dependency. However, led to inefficient industries, technological stagnation, and limited consumer choices. Consumers paid higher prices for lower-quality goods. Eventually contributed to the Latin American debt crisis as protected industries couldn't compete globally.\n\n*3. Japanese Auto Quotas (USA, 1980s)*\n**Effects:** Protected U.S. automakers but increased car prices by an estimated $1,000 per vehicle for American consumers. Created windfall profits for Japanese manufacturers who shifted to higher-end vehicles. American automakers delayed necessary modernization. Cost American consumers approximately $5 billion annually.\n\n*4. South Korean Development Tariffs (1960s-1980s)*\n**Effects:** Initially supported industrial development when combined with export promotion policies. Temporary protection allowed industries like steel and electronics to develop. However, consumers paid higher prices, and eventual liberalization proved difficult politically. Successful mainly because protection was strategic, temporary, and tied to export performance requirements.\n\n*5. U.S.-China Trade War (2018-2020)*\n**Effects:** Caused American consumers to pay approximately $51 billion in additional costs annually. Protected some manufacturing jobs but created job losses in agriculture and manufacturing sectors using imported inputs. Reduced farm exports due to Chinese retaliation. U.S. companies absorbed about 75% of the costs rather than Chinese exporters. GDP growth slowed by an estimated 0.3% while inflation increased.\n\nEach case demonstrates how tariffs create concentrated benefits for specific industries while typically imposing broader costs across the economy through higher prices and reduced economic efficiency.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nNormally in economics, we would argue that results from the past cannot be extrapolated to the future, but with the current market conditions, I\u2019m not so sure. How should we approach this situation?\n\n**Edit: Crazy how many people responded. I found a couple new insights and I\u2019ve got some reading to do. A follow up question I didn\u2019t find in the answers, how are you guys diversifying right now. Both geographically and industry-wise. Any tips?**",

Trump again on social media said he wanted Canada \"to become our cherished Fifty First State.\"\n\n> Canadian Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told Reuters that Canada could impose non-tariff measures such as restricting oil exports to the U.S. or levying export duties on minerals, if U.S. tariffs persist.\n\n> Canada ships about 4 million barrels of crude to the U.S. per day via pipeline, mainly to Midwest refineries. Canadian tariffs on American ethanol are also an option, he added.\n\n> Ottawa last week won a month's reprieve for USMCA-compliant exports from Trump's general 25% tariffs for Canada threatened over fentanyl trafficking.\n\n> But in early April, Canada also faces Trump's reciprocal tariffs aimed at raising U.S. tariffs to match other countries' rates and counteract non-tariff barriers.\n\n> A small business survey on Tuesday showed sentiment weakening for a third straight month, fully eroding a confidence boost following Trump's November 5 election victory, and a survey of households by the New York Federal Reserve on Monday showed consumers growing more pessimistic about their finances, inflation and the job market.",

            "Just saying, I work in manufacturing of drinking water filters for cities. This is in my opinion the most critical infrastructure as clean drinking water is the most important thing to human health except for perhaps being able to breathe. If cities can\u2019t build new or maintain their existing drinking water systems, there would be a REAL public health crisis. Not only will there be a whole nation of Flints as there will be distribution systems contributing age and deteriorating but also filter plants that can\u2019t provide clean water for you to consume and waste water plants that can\u2019t reclaim water. We are ALREADY seeing two things. 1) Tariffs are causing these material prices to skyrocket and thus we are passing those costs onto the end user (cities who buy parts and plants to maintain their systems)thus increasing the price levied on cities (which gets passed to the tax payers to pay via water bills). And 2) with ballooning project prices, cities have to typically secure federally funded grants to finance these projects, grants that are usually at least partially paid back. So the average home owner will again have their property tax bill raised to compensate as well. But with a squeeze by the administration on federal spending, they will be limiting the amount of cities that can secure these now ballooning project prices through the federal grant programs. These is a long line of materials importers to manufacturers and contractors and engineers that will be out of work because of this. I realize this isn\u2019t directly related to investing but it is a huge indicator to me of a coming recession and hard times, just informing you all that these tariffs are indeed very real and have real consequences. Be wise with your investments."

        "text": "The S&P 500 has had a stellar run for the past couple of years, adding roughly $19T from the ChatGPT moment (Nov '22) to the DeepSeek event (Jan '25). I ran some back of the envelope calculations and, by my estimate, at least half of that is AI-driven!\n\nBy AI-driven, I\u2019m referring to two key contributors:\n\n1. First, the \"picks and shovels\" plays in AI data centers, which contributed $4.5 trillion (24% of the S&P's gains), with NVDA leading the charge, accounting for 69% (nice) of this group's gains. While in my table I\u2019ve focused on some of the major players in this space, it's likely I've left out many others, meaning these figures almost certainly underestimate the full impact.\n2. Second, the rest of the Magnificent 7, which have benefited in various ways from the AI narrative, added an additional $5.2 trillion (27% of the S&P's gains).\n\nNow, the big question is: Is the AI trade simply losing some juice, or are we witnessing the start of a full-blown reversal? Since the DeepSeek event, these names have collectively shed $1.3 trillion, suggesting the latter might not be easily dismissed.\n\nWhat does this mean for the S&P going forward? The rest of the pack will have to pick up the slack if we are to see some gains this year, and that is without even considering the big R word.\n\nEdit: figured out how to add the image.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jsbpyg0a7oe1.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=57740fa9c64340bd5a2602381353290cf413bb2f\n\n",

I do not necessarily think that we will run out of need for high performance compute, but at some point the margins may get reduced. NVDA and their CUDA ecosystem will allow for easy transition to other applications.\n\n\n\nThere is also the case for energy efficiency. Even if we do not need more computing power, replacing older GPU's with newer models in the future will yield better energy efficiency. So I do believe you will see an update cycle of current datacenters at some point.",
            "The AI trade isn\u2019t dead, but it\u2019s at a crossroads. The $9.7 trillion AI-driven gain you estimate was real, but its sustainability hinges on whether efficiency (DeepSeek\u2019s model) trumps scale (U.S. hyperscalers).

I've just been letting the cash sit the last few months and cashing out more then depositing into the hood for the interest while I figure out my next move.

        "text": "[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/?f=flair_name%3A%22DD%22)\n\nIn their latest earnings call, while they had revenue from research collaborations, both IONQ and RGTI do not have a commercially viable product, nor do they even have a realistic timeline to one. Both claim, maybe 2030...and quantum computers have always been \"5 more years!\"\n\nSome facts - The RGTI CEO is focused on fidelity - improving accuracy a projected 2x this year! To be commercially viable \"like an NVIDIA GPU\" requires 100,000,000 X accuracy gains...\n\nQuantum Advantage is not a given at lower fidelity rates either.\n\nThe commercial TAMS they claim Quantum will help are not limited by compute (drug discovery, networking, crypto, NFTs, AI, etc.)\n\nAnd now we get to the event coming up; NVIDIA's Quantum Day.\n\nThese stocks went into free fall when Jensen and Zuckerberg admitted quantum tech is many decades out from relevance.\n\nJensen then saved them by stating he was going to host quantum day; MSFT the same day announced for companies to be \"quantum ready for 2025!\" in a blog post.\n\nWe have to ask ourselves why? And what is happening at quantum day?\n\nThe WHY behind NVDA and MSFT is simple - right after this hype marketing on quantum, MSFT reported dissapointing cloud sales to enterprise. MSFT cap-ex on NVIDIA GPUS is dependent on these units sales. MSFT offers the ability to play around with these quantum computers on their cloud for research purposes - though they are typically down and worthless but they do consume a TON of compute.\n\nThis not only marked the top of the market because why would MSFT and NVDA need to pump quantum if AI is going HAM? It's an act of desperation by their marketing teams, simple as.\n\nFinally the coup de grace - QUANTUM DAY (RED WEDDING)\n\nWho is the guest on the same level as NVDA? Crowdstrike. Why? Because the only real application for quantum computers long term is encryption breaking...important for security. The only issue here is; Crowdstrike is invested in avoiding that for their customers so they will DEFINITELY outline how they will invalidate this technology.\n\nWhen the market realizes the only potential use for quantum in decades will be invalidated by tech from players like CRWD, its a headshot.\n\nTo add insult to injury, IONQ's CEO who is attending the NVDIA conference has been comparing themselves to 2015 NVIDIA...claiming Jensen is afraid of them...lol\n\nThis CEO is a serial SPACer and midwit.\n\nEnjoy shorting this or buy puts. I think all will work out. Not financial advice. Maybe buy some short term calls to hedge.\n\nShort with April hedges.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xogflhef73oe1.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=383fd6222262a6237633e591b712a9a6a90975b8\n\n",

        "title": "MicroStrategy (MSTR/STRK) now officially a Ponzi? To hold Bitcoin Bros hostage?",
        "text": "Regardless what you think of Bitcoin, I think MSTR successfully did it, it qualifies for the official Ponzi-Scheme certificate.\n\nSo MicroStrategy (the company that basically doesn't do anything beside holding Bitcoin while trading at 1.5 it's Bitcoin holding's dollar price in market capitalization) issued a preferred stock called STRK. It looks like a Bond, it has a nominal value and it gets a \"fixed dividend\" of 8% annually, every quarter. But if you look at the very complicated prospectus at the SEC, it looks to me as if MicroStrategy doesn't actually need to pay anything at any time. They can always \"default\" on the payment without anything happening other than that the dividend is added to the nominal value and still owed \"later\", kind of like a credit card that can't demand to pay the debt.\n\nSo people, even in the crypto space, were asking how they are gonna pay their first dividends on the 500M$ of STRK that are due March 15th. Regardless of how Bitcoin develops, Michael Saylor, the CEO, repeats the mantra \"never sell you Bitcoin\" like in a cult. But MicroStrategy has no significant income, where should the money come from?\n\nOne possibility was that they right away \"default\" on their first STRK dividends. Oopsy doopsy no money, who could have foreseen that. But the bond price would have collapsed and there is also an option to get one MSTR common share for 10 STRKs, so if the bond trades under 1/10 of the stock, yesterday morning around 250$/10=25$, that could be a risk.\n\nSo instead Michael Saylor (the CEO) announced yesterday that MicroStrategy, now called Strategy, is issuing 21B$ more of those STRK worst-of-both-worlds bonds/stocks. A week before the dividends on the first batch is due. Saylor basically told everyone he is not going to sell Bitcoin, so the only conclusion is he has to borrow more to pay out earlier investors with later investors. If he pays the dividends in a week, there is no doubt where that money came from. Earlier investors payout with later investors, that's the official definition of a Ponzi\n\nI'm sure if he had the option he would have waited with issuing the second batch of 21B$ STRK one fucking week to avoid this insanely strong Ponzi smell and pay those early batch STRK from whatever legitimate income MSTR has, but oops there is none.\n\nBut who is gonna buy that junk? If you believe in Bitcoin mooning, why invest in an 8% bond instead? If you don't believe in Bitcoin, why would you believe MSTR will magically come up with the money to pay you? The answer is: its made for people who are knee-deep in Bitcoin, bag holders, and very afraid of what happens to their Ponzi if the MSTR \"Ponzi in a Ponzi\" goes bust. It's a threat to Bitcoin Bros to buy out all new Ponzi bonds otherwise Saylor might be \"forced\" to sell Bitcoin.\n\nBut I think this might be the moment where the bubble bursts. Obviously the markets can be irrational, and specifically with crypto you're playing poker with monkeys, you can't bluff them because they don't know what poker is. But bubbles tend to burst in an economic downturn. Those Bitcoin bros don't have any cash left for Saylor's Ponzi from buying the 7th Bitcoin dip.\n\nFor Saylor it's really dangerous if enough people understand this. The quicker his stocks plummets the harder it will be to sell these STRKs, as the 10:1 to-stock conversion looks more and more unattractive. If he can't sell his junk bonds, game over.\n\nI have bought a few thousands in puts. I'm recent graduate PhD in Computer Science, I just started to make money and don't have much to invest... I add my position as a comment\n\nEdit: People ask me in the comments: What's new? Saylor doing Saylor things! The news is that everything before that was probably legal. In my opinion most crypto is mainly used as a way to pump and dump ponzis legally. So technically paying out old MSTR investors with new BTC investors wouldn't be a ponzi (although we know it's the same effectively). But what (I argue) he is doing instead, paying out old MSTR with new MSTR investors is really close to jail where I come from (Germany that is). While some old institutional investment managers might not understand BTC, they really will be able to spot the ponzi now. No income did fall from heaven, like they might have hoped.",

I closed them and eventually entered back in aggressively starting 20 days ago when the stock price was at $350/share.\n\nI've officially closed my puts, most recently holding 325x $200p Aug 15 puts. Today alone, I made $396k from the TSLA puts.\n\nOther notable plays was $100k of $QBTS while it was under $1/share after I read\u00a0an article about Chinese researchers cracking encryption using their tech. I made around $300k before closing my position.\n\nFidelity is a great platform, but their charting takes 24 hours to update and they remove gain/loss if you close the position completely, but you can see my performance in the below pictures.\n\nAs a side note, the massive decline in November was associated with IWM puts that got massively underwater from the Trump pump. I held through that entire pump and decline, and was down as much as 80% at one point, before closing for a little loss of 15%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3j1j14k2yne1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=646bd876a47c5e33b23e56686e25b91aed04ff3a\n\n[1 Year Performance](https://preview.redd.it/hj0d7tuk2yne1.png?width=1879&format=png&auto=webp&s=460c51af2e799ee36db06c981f6f1b82608ee43f)\n\n[5 Year Performance](https://preview.redd.it/lc92y8il2yne1.png?width=1887&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8fea3bf7086266da50061310df9de9cc3ef20dc)\n\nThe negative -$83k is shown because I've withdrawn more money than I've put into the accounts.\n\nAs a former TSLA die hard, and owner of 2 Tesla cars, a giant FUCK YOU to Elon.

        "text": "Macro environment\n1. When you ignore your margin call for 6 months and the debt is sold to a collection agency you can legally make them forgive your debt, since you technically own their company. \n2. Total consumer debt is at ita highest level ever, and deliquencies greater than 90 days are their highest since 2008, with the important exception of mortgages. \n3. Household debt service payments as a percent of GDP and a percent of household disposable income are at low levels. I think this suggests that the consumer is mostly healthy, and most deliquent debts should be recoverable. \n\nIndividual stock pick\nI favor PRAA. They recently had a rough patch post pandemic, which resulted in a leadership change and turnaround plan. By all metrics both seem to have been effective, but as of today they are trading near their lowest levels from the past few years. \n1. Praa's p/e ratio is low( 11), when most of their history they traded around 15-20. P/s and p/b ratios are their lowest ever. \n2. As PRAA continues to implement their turn around plan, sales and margins should both increase. Forward pe is around 8.5. \n3. The rest of the market is at a frothy valuation, making this a rare value pick. \n4. The recent dip seems to be a combo of poor consumer sentiment and a bad ER from one of their competitors, plus general market correction. \n5. Praa purchased the most debt it ever has in 2024, which means it should return highest sales/earnings ever in the future. They also have the highest level of estimated remaining collections ever. \n6. None of PRAAs debt comes due for another 2 years. \n7. Return on average tangible equity is forecasted to be 12% this year, a 30% increase over 2024. In 2022, PRAA had a 15% ROATE, and their stock price peaked at $50. \n\nI think PRAA can hit $30 in the next 12 months. \n\nPositions are in the images. Also have about 7000 invested into PRAA in my 401k, soon to be $10k. \n",

Everyone said I was crazy and I cashed out at $12k after a week of being down $8k.  Then I bought back in on another round TSLA, and others and made  $17k bringing me up to $67.8k Thursday as I sold everything.\n\nToday I sold and I'm at $75,221.74 (the graph wont update until tomorrow so i grabbed the total and scrubbed my account data.  I made $7,455.68 this morning although I could have gotten out at $12k.  I was being greedy at first but decided to take the profit after I saw some recovery and wanted to eat lunch.  I'm lazy and have other things in life to do so I'm just taking easy money based on the news.  I could have made more if this was my focus but I'm happy with $36k in the past 2 weeks.\n\nI've been paying attention for years, my dad called the 2k bubble, and I've made money on recessions.  I bought homes in 2008 when everyone was afraid.  My strategy is life experience and it works for me.  Spending more than a few hours a week on this is not what I enjoy in life.  I do what works for me and allows me to enjoy things that bring me happiness.\n\nEDIT - I know I made mistakes on some of my puts, my experience is rusty.  The criticism is appreciated and i learn from it.  I also know this is a special moment in time where I can make money.  I do not day trade because I know I'll grow broke.  I'll wait until the market starts to recover and buy some calls and if I don't see obvious money I'll buy cheap stocks.",

        "text": "Barrons recently came out with an article detailing the hidden worth behind Yeti\u2019s stock beatdown. May not look like much but Yeti has been steadily expanding internationally and its financials have been screaming growth growth growth. Sales grew more than 30% internationally to just under $340 million in 2024 alone. Strong $281 million in net cash at the end of 2024. Quickly moving out of China due to tarriffs and expects 80% of U.S. production capacity to be outside of China by end of 2025.\n\n\u201cBut its not the lost popular waterbottle on the market\u201d\n\nYeti never really focused on fashion and more on getting its products into the hands of athletes through partnerships with schools and teams. Coolers and drink ware survives hard knocks. They\u2019ve always been pretty reliable and steady when it comes to growth and company rep. Not known as the \u201cfleeting trend\u201d but rather steady and the fallback brand for many Americans when they want something of high quality and not necessarily just a fleeting fashion trend.\n\nLmk what yall think.",

            "Here is my bear thesis on Yeti. A few years ago I bought a really nice Yeti hoodie from a local sporting goods store. It was a truly premium hoodie, and even though it was quite expensive I love that thing and it will probably last 20 years. A year later I wanted to buy more of that hoodie in different colors... the local store no longer carried it, so I ordered 2 online from the Yeti store. They screwed up the shipment somehow and it didn't arrive after 2 months, so I contacted their customer support. They were great and sent a new shipment.  There was one minor problem - they processed the transaction 3 times somehow, and sent me 6 hoodies.\n\nOn top of all that, the hoodies they sent me were complete garbage compared to the original, despite being the same exorbitant price. Cheaper zipper, drawstring, thinner material, made in a different country and obviously the cut corners on everything. Don't get me wrong, they were ok... probably the same quality you can get for many cheaper hoodies. However, I would never order from them again at that price for a mediocre product.\n\nTLDR: They are cutting corners, making premium products no longer premium but still charging premium prices, and their customer support is extremely incompetent.",

            "Bruh no one wants to do fuckin economic analysis here. What tickers and calls or puts?",
            "I'm a noob but my take:\n\nThe 10-year US treasury has a high yield of 4.5% since inflation risk in USA is still too great for bond buyers to accept a lower yield, hence lack of bond demand. The growing US debt and lack of attempts to curb it also decreases demand (which is partly why foreign bond buyers like China has reduced their holdings last few years), and Trump wanting to lower USD going forward also don't help.\n\nTreasury/FED needs to roll maturing bonds this year but there probably won't be enough buy demand for the bonds, which will either cause Treasury/FED to have to issue new debt (if Treasury) or print more money (if FED, which increases inflation + increases federal debt interest costs).\n\nTreasury/FED want lower yields on bonds so they can issue new bonds in future with low yields to minimize the increase of the future federal debt interest payment. The FED wants/needs to lower *interest* rates to spur the economy (to ensure unemployment stays low) and stock market, despite 10-year yields currently being high.\n\nThe risk is that bond buyers see the likelihood of inflation increasing with lowered interest rates, which could result in bond yields going higher instead of lower. It's also possible that mortgage interest rates won't come down as much while the bond yields are high. The consequence could be that we get higher inflation (lowered interest rates) + bond yields still high so borrowing is still expensive (because why would loan rates go below bond yields?) and corporations don't grow + USD weakening  + mortgage rates still high -> US consumer spending decreases -> stagflation.\n\nSo Fed/Treasury would really like lower yields on US treasury bonds before lowering interest rates, and they'll attempt to accomplish this (not sure how, unless they buy bonds themselves which screws debt + inflationary).\n\nOff-topic:\n\nWith SP500 being super costly currently (P/E) with risk of lower growth in USA (GPD down etc) + FED Repo account almost being depleted means we won't get another 2024 bull run, and hence the stock market downturn last few weeks. The liquidity from stock market exit isn't going into bonds though (as we see with the yields being this high), but rather into cash, Gold, BTC, Europe, China or emerging markets.\n\nUS stock market will continue to see liquidity exiting for the next few months, until tariffs are removed and/or another round of FED money printing occurs to stimulate economy (at cost of increasing debt + inflation) or Trump going ahead with removal of income tax + lowering corporate tax (at cost of increasing debt). If we somehow see low unemployment% + low inflation in the months ahead (unlikely imo), then recession fears will also abate.\n\nRussel2000 index will suffer more than SP500 (as already seen since December) if stock market liquidity continues to exit due to 401k passive investments continuing to pour into SP500 which is cap-weighted, so Mag7 won't see as much downside as rest of market (all else equal).\n\nThe richest 10% of US population represents 50% of consumer spending currently (grown from 38% in 2005 IIRC). When/if house prices drop + stock assets drop/don't grow, they'll tighten their spending also, with the result being reduced US consumer spending.\n\nConsumer spending is 70% of GDP growth, so with consumer spending down we'll see less growth (recession/stagflation possibly) + debt-to-GDP ratio increasing which means higher proportion of revenue going to debt interest payments and less room (money) to kickstart the economy again. I think US debt spiral is unavoidable eventually (X years) *unless* FED prints money like crazy and go for the (hyper)inflation route with negative real rates etc, *or* drastically reduce medicare/defense spending in budget and go for X years with recession and lowered quality of life for Americans. 3rd option is robot automation development succeeds and USA increases their production by xxx%.\n\nThe tariffs \"implemented\" by Trump currently are bad. The sig-saw way he's implementing/removing them and not communicating with market what they'll be in X months makes US companies freeze their investments instead of actually investing in more US industries. The companies affected by the tariffs have raised their prices by 25% (or whatever the tariff) to pass the expense on to consumer/companies even though it's just threat of tariffs and not actually implemented. This means we get higher prices without any/some new revenue going to US gov.\n\nThe increased price on goods due to tariffs could result in either (I dunno which) lower consumption/demand on those goods by consumers, lowering GDP growth, or continued demand but inflationary + extra revenue to US gov. From the figures I've seen by others, perfectly implemented tariffs would give US gov 130 billion in annual revenue. I think the harm from the current implementation + recession fears he's creating is outweighing those billions. Sentiment could change however when/if tariffs are removed.\n\nIt's possible some/all of I've said above is incorrect. Please correct me if so.",

        "title": "GRRR - Gorilla technology group - A 'deep' dive into",
        "text": "https://preview.redd.it/9y63pv35ione1.png?width=870&format=png&auto=webp&s=12f4f27b42603aa177a784a495d24d16d0eeae77\n\nHey everyone, I'm sharing this DD because, compared to other analyses I've seen, there are some key differences and divergences. This is based on my own research, and I wanted to provide a more complete perspective on Gorilla Technology (GRRR) based on what I found . I\u2019m just a regular small investor (not a financial advisor), currently holding 1,200 shares along with call options ahead of their webinar. I\u2019ve spent a significant amount of time digging into their background, SEC filings, and the controversy surrounding short-seller allegations. If I\u2019ve missed anything or if someone has a different take, I\u2019d be happy to discuss it.\n\n# Is this an AI-generated post?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qenkz99k0pne1.png?width=2433&format=png&auto=webp&s=663e356896e5e3b91f1177f67f541a5bac3d6cda\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpxw7ysu0pne1.png?width=2496&format=png&auto=webp&s=738d68ee81e93eb571caae590636c4f33603698a\n\nMany of you in the comments are suggesting that this was AI-generated. While I can say that I spent a lot of time writing and revising it (especially since English isn\u2019t my first language), you\u2019ll never have proof of that. What I *can* show you, however, are some of the methods I use to conduct my analyses. And yes, I used my LLM to format the text\u2014 < typical indent used, because who wants to read a long, poorly structured post? I mean, even I wouldn\u2019t want to read my own post again like that.\n\n# What Does Gorilla Technology Do?\n\nGorilla operates at the intersection of AI, Industrial IoT, and cybersecurity, providing AI-driven solutions for smart cities and security analytics. Their platforms power video surveillance, facial recognition, network security, and IoT deployments. They work across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America.\n\nRecent MoUs (memorandums of understanding) indicate massive growth potential, including a $1.8B Thai electric-grid modernization project and a large smart government contract in Egypt. While MoUs aren\u2019t finalized deals, they show strong business momentum.\n\nOn March 3, **The Bear Cave**\u2014a research firm that digs up short ideas\u2014released a note raising what they called \u201ccautionary flags\u201d about Gorilla Technology. They highlighted Gorilla\u2019s roughly **1,200%** stock price jump over six months, pointing to the hype around a series of deals and MoUs (Memorandums of Understanding) that might not be fully locked in. The Bear Cave basically argued that investor excitement might be getting ahead of real fundamentals, noting things like Gorilla\u2019s Cayman Islands registration, workforce distribution (a lot in Taiwan), and its pivot into AI under CEO and Chairman **Jay Chandan**.\n\nNaturally, short-selling activity popped up around the same time. But high short interest doesn\u2019t automatically mean the short thesis is correct; it just means some folks think the price is inflated or that there are undisclosed issues. Could be right, could be off.\n\nIn a press release titled \u201c**Gorilla Sets Record Straight on Baseless Market Speculation**,\u201d on march 6, the company addressed what it calls \u201cmisleading and uninformed\u201d rumors. Some key points:\n\n1. **Analyst Coverage**\n   * Gorilla noted it has \u201cBuy\u201d ratings from **Alliance Global Partners** and **Northland Capital**, which they say contrasts with a short-seller\u2019s blog post they believe lacks fact-checking.\n2. **Financial Transparency**\n   * Gorilla says a large chunk of its 2024 Accounts Receivable was collected and reviewed by **Marcum Asia**, part of Marcum LLP, a well-regarded U.S. accounting firm.\n   * Gorilla also plans to be **Sarbanes-Oxley compliant by 2024**, which is way earlier than Emerging Growth Companies typically have to be.\n3. **Business Evolution & Backlog**\n   * Gorilla reiterated it\u2019s now focused heavily on AI-driven \u201csmart city\u201d solutions, has a backlog of around **$93 million** for 2025, and guidance of **$90\u2013100 million** in revenue for this year.\n   * The pipeline apparently jumped from **$2 billion to $6 billion**, referencing a **$1.8 billion MoU** for modernizing Thailand\u2019s electricity grid.\n4. **Upcoming Financials**\n   * They\u2019ll drop their 2024 full-year numbers on March 31, 2025, and file their 20-F on April 15, 2025. If you\u2019re following this stock, those dates should matter big-time.\n\nOne major highlight is a $1.8 billion, 15-year MoU to overhaul Thailand\u2019s electricity grid :\n\n* **Potential**: If it transitions to a real, binding contract, that\u2019s obviously a huge revenue boost.\n* **Caution:** An MoU isn\u2019t a guaranteed contract. There\u2019s room for either party to back away or revise details.\n\nThey\u2019re also part of **ONE AMAZON**, aiming to protect the Amazon Rainforest with biodegradable sensors, AI analytics, and a blockchain-based market (carbon credits, etc.). Gorilla would handle the technical backbone. Big names like Goldman Sachs, AECOM, and Abu Dhabi Investment Group are involved.\n\n# Recent SEC Filings & Corporate Updates\n\nA few key 6-Ks to note:\n\n1. **September 2024 6-K** (Unaudited H1 2024 Financials)Positives: Substantial top-line growth, a move into profitability, and stronger equity. The actuaol concerns is that MoUs aren\u2019t locked revenue, currency exposure in Egypt, and the capital structure can be confusing with those preference shares/warrants.\n   * **Revenue** for first half of 2024: $20.7M vs. $6.4M the prior year.\n   * **Net Income**: $1.61M, flipping from a $7.27M loss.\n   * **Total Assets:** $133.1M (up from $115.4M at year-end 2023).\n   * **Total Liabilities**: $61.1M (roughly in line with $61.3M prior).\n   * **Equity**: $72.1M, compared to $54.2M.\n   * A big chunk of future revenues (over $200M) is in Egyptian pounds (EGP), meaning **currency risk** if EGP/USD moves around.\n   * Gorilla uses convertible preference shares and private warrants to raise capital\u2014creating derivative liabilities (i.e., it can get complicated on the balance sheet).\n   * **Cash**: $11.2M vs. $5.3M at year-end.\n2. **February 2025 6-K**\n   * Gorilla ended its Controlled Equity Offering with Cantor Fitzgerald, so it\u2019s not pursuing that specific route for raising funds (reduces immediate dilution risk but also any quick capital infusion from that deal).\n3. **January 2025 6-K**\n   * Updated shares outstanding to \\~18.46M after warrant exercises and preference share conversions.\n\n**Takeaway**: Solid revenue growth in H1 2024, profitability, and a bigger equity base. But they really need to convert these big MoUs into final contracts and handle that currency risk (especially in Egypt).\n\n# Short interest and Short Squeeze Potential\n\nI know a lot of you are curious about short squeeze potential, given how volatile GRRR has been. As of the latest data (early March 2025), short interest sits around **1.46 million shares, which is \\~8.3% of the float**\n\nThat\u2019s moderately high \u2013 not in the extreme top tier of squeezed stocks, but notable. One red flag for shorts is that short share availability recently **hit zero** (as of March 7, 2025 there were no shares left to borrow at some brokers), and borrow fees have climbed (around 30+%). This indicates a lot of people have already shorted and there isn\u2019t much ammo left for new shorts unless some shares free up.\n\nHowever \u2013 and this is key \u2013 the **Short Interest Ratio (Days to Cover) is only \\~0.17 days**, which is very low. That means given the high trading volume lately, all shorts combined could theoretically cover their positions in a few hours of trading. A low days-to-cover makes a classic squeeze less likely unless something changes (like volume drying up or a sudden catalyst landing). We also see about 34% of total short volume is happening off-exchange (dark pools)\u200b, which some interpret as stealthy shorting. It\u2019s fuel for volatility, no doubt.\n\nBottom line on a squeeze: The short interest is high enough to contribute to wild swings (and the float is small, \\~11M public float), but **shorts aren\u2019t \u201ctrapped\u201d** in the way they are because they can exit relatively quickly. For a true squeeze to happen, we\u2019d likely need a big catalyst or a drastic reduction in volume that strands shorts. It\u2019s a factor to watch, but I\u2019m not banking on a squeeze \u2013 I\u2019m more interested in the business story here.\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\n* **Price**: $28.41 (lower in the premarket)\n* **RSI** (14): 53.0 (kind of neutral, slightly bullish).\n* **MACD**: 4.17 vs. Signal 3.84 (positive crossover).\n* **ADX**: 91.3 (signals an extremely strong trend, but that can also mean huge volatility).\n* **20-Day Momentum**: +57.2% (big upward trend).\n* **5-Day Momentum**: \u20136.2% (short pullback).\n* **Annualized Volatility**: \\~203% (seriously high).\n\nInterpretation: Trend is bullish in the mid-term, but the stock is extremely volatile\n\n# Overall Assessment & My Two Cents\n\n1. **Business & Growth**\n   * Seeing revenue nearly triple from the same period last year is impressive, and flipping to a net profit shows there\u2019s some real traction.\n   * So far, though, a lot depends on huge MoUs (Thailand, Amazon IoF\u2122, Government of Egypt, etc.) becoming fully binding deals\n2. **Bear Cave Critique vs. Bullish Analyst**\n   * The Bear Cave points out that hype may be bigger than tangible results.\n   * Gorilla cites big-name analysts with \u201cBuy\u201d calls and a backlog plus pipeline that\u2019s on the rise. So what? official 2024 numbers in March 2025 and the 20-F on April 15, 2025.\n3. **SEC Filings & Governance**\n   * Ending the Cantor deal might be good if they don\u2019t need the capital (less dilution).\n   * Currency risk in Egypt is real, but if they manage it, that contract could be huge.\n   * The preference shares and warrants can add lumps to the balance sheet (fair-value changes, possible dilution). Something to watch.\n4. **Potential Risks**\n   * MoU or hype not translating into revenue: If these big deals don\u2019t convert, the stock could deflate.\n   * Currency fluctuations: Especially with large EGP obligations.\n   * Volatility: Moves can be abrupt in both directions.\n5. **Catalysts**\n   * Converting the Thailand MoU into a real contract.\n   * The upcoming financial reports (**March 31, 2025, and April 15, 2025**) to see if momentum is real.\n\nBelow there is the actual chart :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tnh6d6aa0one1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cfc85917fd003fc59db226dee5726baf8db54a0\n\n* **Price vs. SMA20 & SMA50** The stock is trading above its 20-day and 50-day moving averages, which generally signals an ongoing bullish trend.\n* **Bollinger Bands** The price has been touching or hovering near the upper band, hinting that it might be in a higher volatility phase (but not necessarily overbought).\n* **Volume** We\u2019re seeing rising volume lately\u2014often a sign of increased interest (and possibly momentum) in the stock.\n* **MACD** The MACD line is above the signal line, which usually points to bullish momentum, though the histogram has pulled back a bit.\n* **RSI (14)** It\u2019s hanging around mid-range, meaning the stock isn\u2019t clearly overbought or oversold right now.\n* **Stochastic Oscillator** This flips around between overbought and oversold zones, so it can confirm short-term swings. Recently it\u2019s been more neutral than extreme.\n* **Williams %R** Similar story to the Stochastic\u2014it\u2019s not maxed out, so not screaming overbought or oversold.\n* **ADX (91.3)** A high ADX indicates a strong trend. Since +DI is above \u2013DI, it tilts bullish.\n* O**BV** On-Balance Volume is trending up, suggesting buyers are still outweighing sellers overall.\n\nIn summay, the chart shows a strong uptrend (with some short-term consolidation signals).\n\n# Addressing some Common Concerns\n\nI want to tackle a few specific points I\u2019ve seen people raise on Reddit \u2013 and correct (or try to) any misinformation out there:\n\n* \u201c**GRRR only had \\~$20M in revenue but a $524M market cap** \u2013 hard pass.\u201d  \u2013 I\u2019ve seen this comment, and it\u2019s quite misleading without context. The \\~$20M figure likely refers to Gorilla\u2019s revenue at some earlier point (possibly the first half of 2024). In reality, Gorilla\u2019s full-year 2023 revenue was about $64\u201365 million (nearly 3\u00d7 higher than 2022\u2019s revenue)\u200b. They guided $72M for 2024 and \\~$90\u2013100M for 2025. So, using $20M to judge the company\u2019s size is way off \u2013 trailing twelve-month revenue is far higher, and forward revenue is expected to be higher still. At a \\~$500M market cap, the stock is trading at roughly 5\u20136\u00d7 2025 sales or around \\~21\u00d7 forward EBITDA (using that $20\u201325M EBITDA guidance). For a company growing revenues triple-digits and projecting \\~30\u201340% growth next year, a 5x sales multiple isn\u2019t outrageous.\n* \u201c**$20\u201325M EBITDA in 2025 isn\u2019t that great for a $500M company**.\u201d  \u2013 This is related to the above. Gorilla\u2019s 2025 EBITDA guidance of \\~$20\u201325M is publicly known. If you strictly value it on that, it\u2019s in the \\~25\u00d7 EV/EBITDA range, which isn\u2019t cheap. But consider two things:\n   * (1) This EBITDA is if they only hit $90\u2013100M revenue. Their backlog and pipeline suggest they could exceed that if things go well (the guidance even explicitly says it doesn\u2019t include any upside from new large contracts in advanced discussion).\n   * (2) High-growth tech companies often trade at rich multiples \u2013 investors are paying for the growth trajectory. If Gorilla executes and grows into, say, $150M+ revenue by 2026 (just a hypothetical), that EBITDA will scale up quickly with their high margins. So, while I wouldn\u2019t say GRRR is a deep-value play on near-term EBITDA, the valuation is arguably reasonable for a high-growth AI/IoT stock. It\u2019s all about whether you believe in their growth story. And remember, the company is already profitable at the net income level (rare for a recent SPAC in the tech space). That profitability and cash generation can support further expansion without constant dilution, which gives some credence to the current valuation.\n* \u201c**Gorilla operates in developing countries \u2013 slow payments and regional risk could choke growth.**\u201d  \u2013 This is a fair concern. Gorilla\u2019s big contracts in regions like Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa do carry execution risk. Government clients in developing markets can be slow to pay, and currency fluctuations can impact the value of contracts. For example, Gorilla disclosed that a significant chunk of its future revenue (over $200M) is denominated in Egyptian pounds (EGP)\u200b, which introduces forex risk if the EGP weakens or if there are delays converting that revenue to USD. We actually saw this concern play out in 2024: Gorilla had a huge Accounts Receivable build-up from some large projects (meaning they had delivered milestones but were waiting to get paid). This spooked some investors. The good news: as noted, they collected the majority of those receivables by August 2024\u200b, showing that, yes, payments might be slow, but they did get paid on those deals. It required active management, but it happened. Furthermore, Gorilla\u2019s recent cash infusion (now \\~$47M in the bank) gives them breathing room to handle working capital swings. The company\u2019s diversification across multiple countries also helps \u2013 slow payment in one country can be offset by cash flow from others. That said, this is absolutely a risk to monitor going forward. When you invest in a company that does business in emerging markets, you have to be aware of things like government bureaucracies, political instability, and currency controls. Gorilla\u2019s management seems aware of this (hence bringing on top auditors, collecting cash early, etc.), but it doesn\u2019t eliminate the risk. I\u2019d just caution that dismissing Gorilla solely because they operate in, say, Egypt or Southeast Asia might be shortsighted \u2013 those are also regions where some of the biggest new smart-city and AI projects are happening. So it\u2019s a risk, but it\u2019s also where the growth is.\n\n# Additional Note: Andre Left (Citron) Under Criminal Indictment\n\nOne interesting development that\u2019s been circulating: an article from the U.S. Department of Justice ([Case Link](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-vns/case/united-states-v-andrew-left)) indicates that **Andrew Left**, a short seller (commonly associated with \u201c**Citron Research**\u201d), was indicted in July 2024 for allegedly running a market manipulation scheme. He has pleaded not guilty, and everyone is presumed innocent until proven otherwise. Trial is set for September 30, 2025. Some are connecting this with the short attacks on GRRR, since Citron has historically published negative reports on certain companies, and The Bear Cave\u2019s critical note on Gorilla also had a short-biased stance. In any event, if it\u2019s true that an affiliated short seller is under indictment for market manipulation, it doesn\u2019t automatically mean the Gorilla short thesis is invalid\u2014but it obviously doesn\u2019t boost that short seller\u2019s credibility. We\u2019ll see how it unfolds in court. **The main point: approach sensational short reports with caution, especially if the author might face credibility issues.**\n\n**Personal Note on the Team & Transparency**  \nOne more thing I always look at when investing is the team behind the company. In Gorilla\u2019s case, they\u2019re surprisingly open and transparent\u2014especially CEO Jay Chandan, who posts regular updates and isn\u2019t shy about interacting with the public. CFO David Bower (joined in 2024) also seems pretty accessible and has a track record in tech finance. Meanwhile, other board members and senior management have been quick to address rumors or speculation. Frankly, a \u201cshady\u201d or \u201cfake\u201d outfit wouldn\u2019t be so active in providing regular press releases and direct comms\u2014especially with earnings around the corner (end of March, plus the 20-F on April 15). If Gorilla were all smoke and mirrors, it\u2019d be madness to hype unrealistic numbers now, only to have them disproven in a few weeks.\n\nIn short, while I\u2019m obviously not guaranteeing anything and still want to see those official revenues come in, I do like a management team that acts unafraid to engage with investors and the public. It\u2019s not conclusive proof of legitimacy, but it beats radio silence. If you\u2019ve got a group that consistently puts out info, addresses questions head-on, and has leaders with decent resumes and experience, it doesn\u2019t scream \u201cfly-by-night\u201d to me. So that\u2019s a small check in the \u201cplus\u201d column until we see those real, hard numbers soon\n\nHope this helps anyone doing research. If you guys hsee something I missed or if I made some sort of mistake, let me know. As with all these small-cap or mid-cap growth plays, do your homework, stay cautious, and good luck.",

        "text": "Been waiting for SPY to break below its lows since election to confirm my thoughts on where we are heading. Played puts early in the week and made a few K but sold. Was going to buy back in but hesitated and missed out. Finally bought back in and these were up, but decided I\u2019d hold this time instead of sell like I did with my OG puts. Those OG puts hit 100% at the bottom Friday. So this time I decided to hold and we will see how that goes. Worst case scenario imo it could take till beginning of April to tank, but I figured I\u2019d hop in now so I don\u2019t miss out if it crawls down little by little till then.\n\nNobody knows obviously, but I feel pretty confident we\u2019re heading down hard. In my opinion I know \u201cthis is different\u201d is kind of getting memed, but I genuinely believe that to be the case. There has been an underlying system since WWII with America at the helm in many ways. There has been decades of role propositioning and reinforcement through reconstruction after the war. So many people talk about an \u201covervalued\u201d market, when it really wasn\u2019t in a relative sense of what American markets represented with reliability, certainty, and trust. I think SOME damage has already been done, and nothing is gonna change that for a long time. In my opinion it really just comes down to how much damage will ultimately be done. With that said, with this administration, and my own run away thoughts, I really can\u2019t pin how far a drop I see as realistic, but obviously with my play I\u2019m expecting around -3% from here absolute minimum.

        "text": "Closed 75 spy 606 5/18 puts on 3/4 when I felt market was oversold, and have been looking for an opportunity to buy calls to take advantage of an oversold market. Picked up 45 qqq 490 6/20 calls right before J Powell\u2019s speech as a gamble on my feeling that market is oversold, and sentiment is too fearful. \n\nBelow are some statements made by Powell that indicated his sentiment that things aren\u2019t too bad right now, and also reassured me that the Fed will step in if things get too bad.\n\n\u201cWhile there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high. As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\u201d\n\n  \u201cIf the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.\u201d\n\nPowell takes his dual mandate very seriously, those of you whom traded back in 2020 remember the fed being instrumental to pulling the levers needed to protect the economy, encourage lending, which ultimately led to a v shaped market recovery in 04/2020. If things get bad enough (I don\u2019t think they will), or policies become even more unpredictable (I\u2019m not holding my breathe), Powell will step in again to uphold his mandate and protect our economy, and our investment portfolios.\n\nI entered another good till cancelled limit order for 55 qqq 490 6/20 at $20. If it is not exercised that\u2019s okay, if it is, then I get to \u201cbuy the dip.\u201d I plan to hold on to my calls until qqq crosses 525,  or market sentiment significantly improves, whichever comes sooner. At that point I will go back to holding puts to hedge. \n",

RDDT is one of the handful of social media platforms I think is actually useful at this point.

        "text": "Since my last post ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ishu2q/para_yolo_undervalued_giant_with_massive_upside/)) there have been some very important developments in $PARA\u2019s price action and merger.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI originally wrote my DD post when $PARA was at about $10.60, and didn\u2019t finish and post it until $PARA had broken out to about $11.30. Between the time I started writing my thesis on Paramount\u2019s bull case (and opened my first position at $10.51) and now, the price has rallied about 12%. I believe that the price action during this time has confirmed my bull case and an important part of my original DD that I intentionally left out to wait for confirmation. Keep in mind that this bullish trend has taken place in a highly volatile selloff of the market. If SPY can turn bullish, I don\u2019t see why $PARA wouldn\u2019t FLY. Shoot, it may even flyt with the market still being a turd.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Summary of the technicals:**\n\nThe daily golden cross just happened as of 3/7/25.\u00a0From a technical perspective, this is one of the most bullish signs you can find on a chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4t6166hmbne1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa41fc47b31ec6d535f9dbba6a573419b6eae18f\n\nNow for the important pattern that I have been monitoring extremely closely: we\u2019ve just passed the Last Point of Supply in what I think is one of the cleanest Wyckoff Accumulation patterns I\u2019ve ever seen\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b5yzgczhmbne1.png?width=2384&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a9a7770452ea15363e339a484d9988b60edcdb5\n\nDaily RSI has just reentered the bull zone, trendline is heavily bullish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vkwppt2jmbne1.png?width=2385&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebb6fbfaa17a2dfb1672832bbf9903bace73a472\n\n\u00a0\n\nDaily ADX looks fantastic. This bullish trend is still just getting started.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e627bftjmbne1.png?width=2384&format=png&auto=webp&s=63ad3818ecfed45c1580acc5f07b7d72c8105445\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Non-technicals:**\n\nWe passed earnings and it was a non-event. Paramount+ memberships rose 3.5 million in the quarter, and revenue was just shy of $8B. Still absurdly undervalued, in part due to the impending merger and presumed dilution from it. But wait, because there is important merger news\u2026.\n\nIf you recall from my previous post, the collapse of the merger would lead to the unwinding of a HUGE bearish position and arbitrage play that has been set up. About $43M in bearish puts, and 11% short interest (71.5M shares). Between the two, 45% of the free float is exposed to a short position.\n\nWell, it was just announced that a judge may be putting a halt on the merger:\u00a0[Judge may consider blocking Paramount-Skydance deal\u00a0 | Reuters](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Fmarkets%2Fdeals%2Fjudge-may-consider-blocking-paramount-skydance-deal-2025-03-06%2F&data=05%7C02%7C%7Cb12ce176bce4459807be08dd5cfa05c8%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638768951119773025%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=T9VAcDw4HsBM%2FIHt951aK6k0xWOYaDxWLYNisSVQ%2Bkw%3D&reserved=0)\n\nThe above article also indicates that the merger has 2 weeks before closure (3/20 at the earliest), and that there is up to 6 months of potential delays depending on FCC approval and court proceedings (further sources indicate that the FCC review will almost certainly take until the summer). My belief is that this 3/20 date will come and go without closure. If litigation continues (it will) and the maximum delay of 6 months plays out, then that\u2019s a long time to hold a bleeding short position\u2026.\n\n**Lets also consider the following scenario:** if the judge determines that the offer from Skydance was, in fact, an unfair offer for shareholders due to the immediate dilution expected upon closure and the premium paid to Shari Redstone and Skydance, this would likely cause Paramount to pursue and accept the PRP offer (details below), which has NO risk of dilution and strengthens the balance sheet of $PARA significantly. It is a fundamentally better offer, and if it goes through, then the stock will become completely unbound from the assumed downside risk and can be free to experience true price discovery. Cue the RAPID unwinding of short positions.\n\nPRP offer: [Project Rise Partners Issues Open Letter to Paramount Shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/project-rise-partners-issues-open-155600007.html)\n\nPRP is actively involved in litigation: [Project Rise Partners Submits Friend of the Court Brief](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/project-rise-partners-submits-friend-161300147.html)\n\nOh, what\u2019s this\u2026 [Judge opens door to possible bidding war for Paramount as it scrambles to close $8B Skydance merger](https://nypost.com/2025/03/04/business/judge-opens-door-to-possible-bidding-war-for-paramount-as-it-scrambles-to-close-8b-skydance-merger/) a whistleblower?\n\nIs there any basis to the claims of a breach of fiduciary responsibility and corruption as part of this deal? Well the courts are indicating that there may be: [Paramount Ordered to Release Skydance Merger Records to Investor](https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-ordered-skydance-merger-records-release-pension-fund-shari-redstone/) and [NYC pension funds sue to delay Paramount-Skydance deal pending court review of alleged fiduciary breach | Pensions & Investments](https://www.pionline.com/courts/nyc-pension-funds-sue-delay-paramount-skydance-deal-pending-court-review-alleged-fiduciary)\n\n\u00a0We\u2019ve seen short positions get blown up in these situations before\u2014when retail exposes the imbalance and institutions have to scramble to close their positions. PRP\u2019s deal could be the catalyst that triggers the unwinding of short positions and explosive price action, and momentum behind the PRP deal is building. Even the faintest hint of it being a possibility, and the stock has risen 5.5% this week despite the S&P continuing to sell off.\n\nAnd the Trump lawsuit is close to being settled or tossed out entirely (surprise, surprise\u2026 it was utter nonsense to begin with):\u00a0[Paramount Moves to Throw Out Trump\u2019s \u201960 Minutes\u2019 Suit: \u2018An Affront to the First Amendment\u2019](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aol.com%2Fparamount-moves-throw-trump-60-211905457.html&data=05%7C02%7C%7Cb12ce176bce4459807be08dd5cfa05c8%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638768951119803261%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=1xa8zOzuYaYxM1sU7pauA6WU4OL4wJAhKJ6HvX%2BuZHY%3D&reserved=0) \u2013 this was never something to take seriously, but a few people brought it up on my previous post.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe wheels are turning, and I believe that this is one of those very few trades that can be life changing if it unfolds how I believe it may. Retail needs to rally behind the stock, spread the truth about the PRP offer and corrupt SD offer, and pressure the courts to demand fairness for $PARA shareholders. So, my ask of you is this: share this DD and help the truth get out. If it does and pressure mounts, then PARA is primed to do something very special.\n\n*\\*Quick disclaimer\\* - I know WSB takes the whole short squeeze thing very sarcastically these days. While that is a generally reasonable perspective, this is a deep value play that has a heavily imbalanced short position that will need to be unwound if the presumed dilution is no longer a factor. I did not buy this stock because of the short position, and nor should you. It's merely an exciting thing to ponder the possibility of.*\n\n\\*edit: not sure why my first two pictures are being auto-deleted. Will fix ASAP.",

Repeat and profit.\n\nWhy is this the perfect strategy? *Because the auto industry cannot survive those tariffs.* Trump still hasn't realized this and seems dead set on bringing back those tariffs on April 2nd. I've started this strategy earlier today (see position below) and will give an update in a month. Of course if Trump gives up on the idea of tariffing the auto industry, then I will liquidate everything.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9scpruo8x6ne1.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff8420ba35ca6d73cc28fbeaca47d8bdeda5860b\n\nUpdate: I loaded the fuck up over time while $GM pumped.

        "text": "\n\nDecent day. Could have been better, could have been worse. I took 67.5k off the table before open, and basically made it all back by this late afternoon. \n\nScreen shot of yesterday\u2019s closing value (204k) + screenshot of transfer (I cut out all none pertinent info) + logs. \n\nAi summery:\n\n1. Recap of Day 5\n\t\u2022\tAnother Massive Gain (+$70k)\nThe account climbed from around $206k to over $273k in one trading day\u2014about a $70k increase, or roughly +34% on the day.\n\t\u2022\tSame Ultra\u2010Short\u2010Dated SPX Options Strategy\n\t\u2022\tThe trader again used a flurry of 0DTE (zero\u2010days\u2010to\u2010expiration) or near\u2010expiration SPXW calls and puts.\n\t\u2022\tQuick flips in/out throughout the session, often capturing sharp intraday moves in the S&P 500.\n\t\u2022\tPartial Profit\u2010Taking\n\t\u2022\tThey transferred $67,500 out of the account\u2014over 100\u00d7 the initial $660 stake\u2014locking in a chunk of the gains while still trading with house money.\n\nIn the logs, you see the same pattern:\n\t\u2022\tBuy to Open near\u2010the\u2010money puts/calls.\n\t\u2022\tSell to Close those options within minutes or hours, often at significantly higher (or sometimes lower) premiums, depending on the market\u2019s direction.\n\t\u2022\tRepeated contract sizes of 5, 10, 15, etc., with strikes shifting frequently around the current S&P index level.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n2. Five\u2010Day Streak Summary (Starting $660 to $273k)\n\t1.\tDay\u2010by\u2010Day Explosion\n\t\u2022\tThe account apparently ballooned from $660 to $200k+ in just four days\u2014an incredibly rare feat in itself\u2014then added another $70k on day 5, hitting ~$270k+.\n\t2.\tHighly Leveraged \u201cGamma Scalps\u201d\n\t\u2022\tEvery day\u2019s logs show the same overarching style: riding short bursts of market momentum in SPX options that expire within a day or two.\n\t\u2022\tBecause these options are extremely sensitive to short\u2010term price moves, it\u2019s possible to see 100%\u20131,000% intraday gains\u2014if the trader gets the direction right repeatedly.\n\t3.\tRapid Fire In/Out\n\t\u2022\tThere are no straightforward \u201cbuy and hold\u201d trades; nearly all are scalps or short swings. With so many trades, it\u2019s likely they\u2019re consistently locking in small (and sometimes large) wins every few minutes/hours.\n\t4.\tHuge Risk & Improbable Success\n\t\u2022\tWhile these gains are obviously happening for this individual (based on the screenshots), this streak is statistically extraordinary. Most traders attempting 0DTE strategies face major drawdowns or blow up.\n\t\u2022\tDoing it five days in a row, each day compounding the position size, is extremely rare\u2014truly an outlier event.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n3. Key Observations\n\t\u2022\tMomentum & Directional Accuracy\nThe trader seems to be nailing the intraday direction of the S&P 500 or at least quickly cutting losers and letting winners run.\n\t\u2022\tScaling Up\nAs the account grew, they appear to be taking larger positions (20\u201350 contracts in some logs), so each correct move yields bigger absolute gains.\n\t\u2022\tLocking In Profits\nBy transferring out $67.5k (over 100\u00d7 the original stake), they\u2019ve ensured this wild run isn\u2019t entirely at risk on the next trade. This is a textbook example of \u201csecuring some profits\u201d while continuing to trade aggressively with remaining capital.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n4. Overall Takeaway\n\nThe five\u2010day streak from $660 to $273,500\u2014and now partial profit\u2010taking\u2014showcases one of those ultra\u2010rare, real\u2010time examples of a high\u2010octane 0DTE SPX options strategy hitting near\u2010perfect trades each day. It\u2019s an astronomical run, far beyond what most traders experience or could replicate consistently. That said, it\u2019s an impressive testament to both the potential upside of leveraged short\u2010term options and the immense risk\u2014where a single trade gone wrong might have wiped out earlier gains.\n\n",

Imagine dropping every dime into VOO or something 5 years ago and 1. Getting every second of stressful trading time back and 2. Making the EXACT SAME amount of money (these last 5 years you actually would have made triple but I don\u2019t need to exaggerate the point)\n\nFor some people, like you and me - we are not good at options. We lose. Our options are: sit back with all your money in funds and live stress-free while most probably outpacing the gains we\u2019d make with options. Or continue with options, suffer for 5 years over every decision, and MAYBE have one blow out trade every 5 years like this (also unlikely). Just do a little thinking about the mental peace you sacrificed these last 5 years. Was it really worth 200% less than you would have gotten if you put it all in a fund and didnt spend your time doing it? This is not to belittle you, it\u2019s a genuine question you need to figure out, as you\u2019ve already been through the gauntlet. Is it worth it to do it again?",

        "text": "We are on the precipice of massive volatility in the market, and I think it's only right to share what I think could be a massive play in the medium term off of VIX Calls.\n\nIn Trump's address to Congress last night, he did not sugarcoat what his plans will do - saying to farmers that there will be pain, although coming out the other side stronger. The tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico are going to drive an insane amount of inflation. GDP Now is showing a massive contraction this quarter, (importantly, not just from import frontloading, but from massive investment slowdowns), and jobs reports are down. Yet, the market keeps chugging along, irrational as ever about the status quo collapsing around them. Fuck, even this morning, SPY ripped 1.5% on just auto being exempt from the tariffs.\nQuite, simply, we're pretending everything's fine, and everything's not fine. All its gonna take for the market to rip downward is a bit more inflation, and layoffs, and retail is going to start dipping heavy into their invested money to stay afloat. Combine that with the market plugging its ears and screaming at the massive political instability, when something does finally break through to them - whatever it ends up being, a super negative job report, the next terrible inflation report - the market will rip through the floor in panic. It doesn't have to stay there - for vix calls to be worth it, you don't have to be right everytime, you only have to be right once.\n\nJust a reminder on GDP about to rip through the floor: \n",

        "text": "Expecting endless volatility in the market for the next given months on end, can someone tell me why this would be a bad trade?\n\nBoth contracts are deep in the money, limiting the extrinsic value paid to about 3.7%.\n\nAs long as market swings one way or the other by the end of the week, and overcoming the 3.7% cost hurdle of potential decay, this should be a profitable trade? No?\n\nExample: since delta cannot equal 1 or 0 as long as time>0, getting contracts initially where both deltas are around 1 means that as long as one side remains net positive, that delta will be 1 and the other will be less than one (until the date of expiry) meaning you will pick up profit with even the slightest move on other side.\n\nPlease give me feedback. Would love to discuss my DD!",

            "If you don't have the underlying and the credit does not put it OTM you are donating money to someone risk free\n\nIf it's a debit spread you are taking an ultra low probability bet on a crash or moon never seen before on a diversified equity\n\nQQQ/SPY is not where mispriced options are up for grabs for retail\n\nYou don't sell and buy from the same people, and even if you did they would just excercise and best case, with a debit spread, you would hand someone the difference\n\nWith a credit spread the same would happen except you would have no protection kick in under specific conditions and be on the hook for 100 shares",
            "What broker is this?",
            "I'm not an expert in option but I know that a strangle in order to be profitable requires a lot of volatility so the move one way or another must be big and in a short period of time. That's why people use it as earnings play. Where the volatility is big in a short period of time. Know a itm strangle based on future volatility, I think it's not good because the move can be in either direction but the price won't change much since it's already itm and the volatility in the market it's not as high as individual stocks. I think is better to bet the strangle otm delta. 30 30 to 45 days out, and if the market crashes you make money. If the market goes up a lot, it can work out too. But as you are doing it, I don't think it's going to work.",
            "What happens if the Vix drops to 12 because some bullish catalyst came out and everyone\u2019s fear are assuaged? Not a bad idea overall but your biggest enemy will be volatility fluctuations, you\u2019re basing your math off the Greeks on the individual products you are looking at, but those products are priced off a market environment in totality. You basically need a strong move that holds in either direction and you\u2019d need to close those in a precise manner - in this market it\u2019s not unrealistic to imagine a sharp move up on news that chilled the market out followed by a 50% retracement and then chop for a week or two, and that would kill a position like that. \n\nIt\u2019s not as pretty to look at in tos and requires more time to set up but if I want to do something like you are describing I usually set up a synthetic spread of individual long contracts that do not expire at the same time, it takes more capital but it stops both sides from getting cooked by vol fluctuations and if you get a super strong move (and the most likely move should always be first to expire) then you make your money and can either hold the longer dated position for a reversal, or close it with some value still on it due to the extrinsic if it\u2019s at least a week out.",

        "text": "I\u2019m sure some of you heard the headlines around Panama yesterday. Blackrock announced that they led a group of private investors to purchase[ two of the surrounding ports near the canal](https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/blackrock-strikes-23-billion-deal-for-ports-on-both-sides-of-panama-canal-d42a5b5e). The president praised the action during his televised address and you can rest assured that no part of this was a surprise to either him or the institutional investors involved in the matter.\n\nYou see, Blackrock has been aiming to become a major player in infrastructure and energy transition markets, and [recent major acquisitions in the last few months\u00a0 ](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=blackrock+gip+acquisition)have paved the way to accomplishing that end. I\u2019ve been following them closely ever since I noticed their involvement in the mining, metals, and rare earth sector in Ukraine. I had written a separate \\[DD\\] explaining why I believe that sector was about to have a massive run [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/)\n\nPresently, I want to bring your attention to the positioning and posturing made by Blackrock, as well as Trump-affiliated mining, metals, and drilling executives, ever since the November election. I believe that we will see similar involvement by that firm in the reconstruction of Ukraine, as well as in supporting mining and processing of rare minerals and metals both in that region and in the USA domestically.\n\n**I. As you sleep, Blackrock buys, then buys, and buys some more**\n\nIn previous discussions, I mentioned a number of companies that I believe are uniquely situated to benefit dramatically from private and governmental support in the western rare earth supply chain, especially at mid-stream, including MP materials which is [presently the only american company that is operational in their mining, extracting, and processing of rare earth,](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/) especially when it comes to the heavy minerals deemed most essential to our national security.\n\nWould you like to know something curious? [Blackrock acquired a 10% stake of MP](https://fintel.io/so/us/mp) with haste after Trump\u2019s election. A few days following the election, Gina Rinehart, a mining magnate, Australia\u2019s richest women, and close friend to the president, also acquired an [8.5% stake of MP](https://fintel.io/i/hancock-prospecting-pty-ltd) through a new investment group created under Hancock Prospecting in Q4 2024.  Rinehart had previously been in discussion with MP materials over a potential merger that would see MP materials and Lynas Rare Earth [(a company that Rinehart has significant ownership in as well](https://www.mining.com/web/australian-billionaire-gina-rinehart-buys-stake-in-rare-earths-producer-lynas/) and which is the largest producer of rare earth outside China) combine forces to create a unified company capable of posing a serious threat to [Chinese stranglehold over the chain](https://www.google.com/search?q=mp+and+lynas+rinehart&client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=b3124e538ea91f17&sxsrf=AHTn8zp30_wTmF7gaP7WD3QbzwF6FDOmDw%3A1741175001245&ei=2TjIZ93gDqeJptQPx7TfoAQ&ved=0ahUKEwidscOr7vKLAxWnhIkEHUfaF0QQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=mp+and+lynas+rinehart&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiFW1wIGFuZCBseW5hcyByaW5laGFydDIFECEYoAFI-gdQigFYlAdwAXgAkAEBmAGqAaABnAeqAQM2LjO4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgegAsYFwgIFECEYqwKYAwCIBgGSBwMzLjSgB5kY&sclient=gws-wiz-serp). The idea, as far as I know, was that Lynas would wind down operations in Australia and begin significant investments scaling with MP in the United states. This aligns with present administration efforts to support the domestic chain. In fact, Lynas has a contract with the federal government to build a processing plant in the US anyways.\n\nI have to say that convergence between institutions like Blackrock and private equity in recent months in this sector do not stop at MP or Lynas. Here is a list of some companies that I have been interested in within the mining, metals and rare earth minerals sector, as well as the corresponding ownership stake taken by Blackrock and other investors in recent months:\n\n>**MP Materials**: 9.50% Blackrock, 8.5% Rinehart (15% of Rinehart\u2019s portfolio)  \n**UUUU:** 8% Blackrock; Rinehart also invested  \n**LAC**: 5% Blackrock; Rinehart also invested  \n**TECK**: 6.6% Blackrock, 2% Rinehart (20% of Rineharts portfolio)  \n**TTEK -** 9.7% Blackrock, tripled stake in company in February, 2025. Ken Griffin  \n**HES -** 8.5% Blackrock; Citadel CEO Ken Griffin also increased his share by \u2026\u00a0 26,099,166% \ud83d\ude02  \n**TSLA** \\- 5% Blackrock, Q4 they added more shares of TSLA than any other stock; RH\n\nBlackrock has also quietly been making significant acquisitions of shares of [Endeavour Mining](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/03/3035908/0/en/Endeavour-Announces-Holding-s-in-Company.html) as recently as in March 2025 and I have also found institutional support for a number of related sectors, such as VAL for offshore drilling infrastructure.\n\nRinehart had also invested 7% into an Argentinian Lithium company in Q4, 2025. She appears close with the president of Argentina, actually. They took a selfie together at the inauguration party in DC.\n\n[Rinehart with Argentina's President, Javier Milei](https://preview.redd.it/6dvpy9obcvme1.jpg?width=1092&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccc8573d3792788b629ff2bb29300f702c0497e7)\n\nI wonder if there are any looming partnerships in the works? I bet so.\n\n**II. Rampant Speculation**\n\nThe president has promised dramatic action in mining and resource production in the USA in the coming week. He mentioned it on his address to the senate last night. I doubt it was news to the institutionally powerful, though, in the same way that I doubt it is a coincidence that short put interest on MP has been \\~12,000 w/ expiry mid-march, [only to then dramatically fall off the cliff for expiry mid-april.](https://fintel.io/sopt/us/mp)\u00a0\n\nI wonder what will happen? Here is some rampant speculation: MP\u2019s CEO has reduced his share to a feeble 9.5% stake in the company whilst Blackrock and Rinehart have increased there\u2019s to match. **I would not be surprised if we see Blackrock, Rinehart/Hancock, and MP working together to dramatically scale USA rare earth production.** This would also fit with language in executive order on minerals and mining, leaning on Quadrilateral Security Partners.\n\nI also found the positioning with LAC particularly interesting given that they are awaiting approval for the largest [north american lithium mine](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/LAC/lithium-americas-increases-mineral-resource-and-reserve-for-thacker-dvrd2ok6wzyj.html). They are also partnered with GM. I wonder how direct private equity investment and further deregulation and government expediting of the usual processes may impact this company, and with what timeline? I think we see movement sooner rather than later, but I\u2019m just some guy.\n\nAnyways, here are my positions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vpwqzk7hvme1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bb35db6ec5e0c255cca0ac219858847211e757e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e3vz24l7hvme1.jpg?width=665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60b9eaeb704d976aa7d66f90a00ba83465c16ea6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3juo44g9hvme1.jpg?width=716&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94f7cc2a752471139a7985c9c016c73844aab70a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nate05g9hvme1.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=119ab3dd4884f620dde10447b09fdbb859b18147\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9bg6h4g9hvme1.jpg?width=687&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51896d84eb328de6a5681043b24ca9a8a4f2cf20\n\nTl;dr: Firms like blackrock have positioned themselves to take considerable control over the American rare earth and metals supply chain.

        "title": "LLY 267k Long Position - A Dual-Catalyst Driven ~4X Play",
        "text": "Listen up regards. The market is selling off. Your portfolio is red. Trump tariffs and trade wars are here. Why would you ever want to take on a long position? Here is some free alpha.\u00a0\n\n# Background: Eli Lilly and the \u201cmiracle drug\u201d GLP1\u00a0\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) is currently the world\u2019s largest biotech/pharmaceutical company with a market cap of \\~874B, largely due to its dominance in the rapidly growing GLP1 obesity drug market. The revenue of the entire GLP1 market is estimated to be \\~44-55B, and the GLP1 market is expected to grow at a CAGR of \\~15-30% for the next 5 years. LLY\u2019s GLP1 business generated \\~22B in GLP1 revenues in FY24, representing \\~40-50% of total GLP1 market share (depends on estimates) and \\~48% of LLY FY24 revenue. LLY GLP1 grew at an annualized rate of 60%, which management expects to continue into FY25. LLY currently trades at a trailing PE of \\~77x and a forward PE of \\~40x, with its relatively high valuation attributable to high expectations for its GLP1 business.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOf the \\~250MM adults in the US, 40% or 100MM are obese, compared to 39% of the global adult population. Total GLP1 Total prescriptions in the US is estimated to be around 7.1MM adults, 2MM of which are for obesity. This represents 2% of obese US adults and even less internationally, and with LLY capturing \\~57% of share, this signals massive opportunities for growth. According to recent surveys, 1 in 8 consumers have used GLP1 products, while 26% of US consumers expect to use GLP1 in 2025. Massive demand for GLP1 is apparent, and the main bottleneck for growth is LLY\u2019s ability to meet demand. \u00a0  \nAs a result, major investor focus is on LLY GLP1 manufacturing capabilities, which LLY has been heavily investing in.\u00a0\n\nLLY Growth Challenges\u00a0\n\n1. Supply Constraints \u2013 supply cannot keep up with demand as there is not enough manufacturing capacity\u00a0\n2. High Prices \u2013 FDA approved GLP1 products are expensive, and most healthcare plans refuse to cover for obesity, customers unwilling to pay out of pocket\u00a0\n3. Cheaper Alternatives \u2013 supply constraints and high prices cause customers to seek compounded drugs as an alternative\u00a0\n4. Aversion to injection \u2013 current injectable format less attractive than oral drugs, dampening demand\u00a0\n\nCompetitive Landscape: LLY, NVO, and the Compounders\u00a0\n\nEli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NVO, the producer of Ozempic) are direct competitors in what is currently a two-player obesity drug market. However, due to the exceptionally high demand for GLP1 products, the combined supply from both companies has been insufficient in meeting demand, causing the FDA to declare both Tirzepatide and Semaglutide to be in shortage in 2022. This allowed for the compounding of GLP1 drugs under Section 503A and 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). Compounders consisting of both licensed physicians and outsourcing facilities could legally produce non-FDA approved versions of GLP1 drugs for both medical and commercial purposes, selling to customers at significantly cheaper prices compared to the patented, FDA-approved drugs of LLY and NVO. For example, Zepbound (LLY\u2019s brand for obesity) costs $1000/month in 2024 while a compounded version could sell for as low as \\~$45/month on HIMS. However, in October of 2024, the FDA removed Tirzepatide and Semaglutide from the shortage list after over two years, leading to the Outsourcing Facilities Association filing a suit against the FDA, and the case in currently pending.\u00a0\n\n# LLY \u2013 A Combination of Short-Term Catalysts\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMajor Catalysts Overview\u00a0\n\nHere is an overview of the most important catalysts in the upcoming 1-2 months:\u00a0\n\n1. OFA v. FDA preliminary injunction and case results (expected March-April, [here](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69232675/outsourcing-facilities-association-v-united-states-food-and-drug/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc))\u00a0\n2. Multiple Orforglipron (Orfor) Ph3 trial data (first expected in April, case [here](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05971940))\u00a0\n3. Final US Government Budget Decision (deadline end of April, article [here](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2025-02-26/the-house-passed-a-budget-blueprint-what-happens-now))\u00a0\n4. Pharmaceutical tariffs (25% and/or reciprocal, article [here](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-plans-invest-27-billion-new-us-plants-trump-threatens-pharmaceutical-2025-02-26/))\u00a0\n\nWhile we highlight four potential catalysts, 3 and 4 are macro-level catalysts. We will focus primarily on Catalysts 1 and 2 (OFA v. FDA and Orfor Ph3 trial data), with our significant confidence (ahead of market consensus) in both catalysts being positive for LLY as the core of our long thesis. Both catalysts de-risk and pull strong growth levers for LLY.\u00a0\n\nAdditional Levers for Growth\u00a0\n\nBeyond the Catalysts 1 and 2, we also briefly note additional tailwinds for LLY, though these are not the focus of our thesis:\u00a0\n\n1. Growing supply capacity and continued investment in infrastructure and manufacturing (news release [here](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-plans-more-double-us-manufacturing-investment-2020))\u00a0\n2. Pricing power with recent Zepbound and Mounjaro price cuts (news release [here](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-launches-additional-zepbound-vial-doses-and-offers-new))\u00a0\n3. Increasing coverage for GLP1 by healthcare insurance (slowly, article [here](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/glp-1-drug-coverage-for-obesity-increasing/733596/))\u00a0\n\n# Catalyst 1: OFA v. FDA\u00a0\n\nThe FDA took Tirzepatide off the drug shortage list, in October 2024 and February 2025, respectively. The Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA) subsequently filed a lawsuit against the FDA. The core of plaintiff's \\\\case argues that FDA\u2019s removal should be considered notice-and-comment \u201crulemaking\u201d under the APA, while the FDA argues that their actions fall under \u201cinformal adjudication\u201d and does not require notice-and-comment. Judge Pittman has stated that he intends to rule this case as a \u201cmatter of law\u201d; the case will be decided depending on whether he considers FDA\u2019s removal of Tirzepatide from the shortage list as adjudication or rulemaking according to legal precedent and relevant cases brought forward by both sides.

A very helpful podcast with biopharma lawyer Julia Cantu summarizing the situation can be found [here](https://www.martilawgroup.com/post/update-on-tirzepatide-compounding-the-fda-lawsuit-and-the-february-18th-deadline).\u00a0\n\nGLP1 Compound Market Size\u00a0\n\nTo motivate why the OFA v. FDA case is significant for LLY, we project the potential revenue gain by estimating the current GLP1 compounding market.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOne outsourcing facility, FarmaKeio (FK), has been selling roughly \\~1.75-2 MM worth of Tirzepatide every month at \\~$45/month. Hims and Hers (HIMS) reported 222 MM worth of revenue from compounding GLP1, also with prices around $45/month. With the total market for GLP1 estimated to be around 54 B in sales for 2024 and LLY and NVO representing \\~42 B, the compounding market could represent \\~12 B, or around 22% of the total GLP1 market. At the high end, up to 30% or \\~16 B of GLP1 sales could be from compounders (according to [Beckers Hospital Review](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/glp-1s/30-of-glp-1-medications-acquired-via-compounding-pharmacies.html)).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nGiven that compound Tirzepatide is \\~10-20x cheaper than brand Tirzepatide and the logical assumption that demand is relatively inelastic, we claim absolute GLP1 sales would not be significantly lower without compounding. Taking the baseline of no change in absolute sales and assuming LLY takes 60% share (based on current LLY/NVO market share), an end to compounding is a one-time \\~20-30% boost to revenue, assuming LLY can meet demand.\u00a0\n\nMy Perspective on OFA v. FDA\u00a0\n\nThe result of this case lies purely in Judge Pittman\u2019s interpretation of the FDA\u2019s actions under the APA vis-\u00e0-vi legal precedence, particularly the following cases presented in court submissions (which I have selected for relevance):\u00a0\n\n* Safari Club Int\u2019l v. Zinke, 878 F.3d 316, 333 (D.C. Cir. 2017)\u00a0\n* United States v. Florida East Coast Ry. Co., 410 U.S. 224, 246 (1973)\u00a0\n* Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 101 (2015)\u00a0\n* McDonald v. Watt, 653 F.2d 1035, 1042 (5th Cir. 1981)\u00a0\n* BNSF Ry. Co. v. Fed. R.R. Admin., 105 F.4th 691, 701 (5th Cir. 2024)\u00a0\n* Little Sisters, 591 U.S. at 683\u201384, 685\u201386 (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b))\u00a0\n* Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 221 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring) (quoting Attorney General\u2019s Manual on the APA 14 (1947))\u00a0\n* City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, 668 F.3d 229, 243 (5th Cir. 2012)\u00a0\n* Qwest Servs. Corp. v. FCC, 509 F.3d 531, 536\u201337 (D.C. Cir. 2007)\u00a0\n* Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 202 F.3d 788, 796\u201397 (5th Cir. 2000)\u00a0\n\nA quick meta-analysis shows that in administrative cases, conservative judges such as Judge Pittman tend to err on the side of allowing regulatory agencies to exercise their powers less striking legal transgressions. Intuitively, conservative judges would seek to intervene less in such disputes and refer to the experts and authorities; in this case, the FDA. Furthermore, closer scrutiny reveals Plaintiff\u2019s argument centered on Safari Club ignores marked differences between the rulemaking of the US Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) and the delisting by the FDA.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn Safari Club, USFWS concluded that killing of elephants did not meet the \u201cenhancement requirement\u201d under the existing Endangered Species Act (ESA), which stated that trophy hunting imports should be consistent with the conservation of the species. While the \u201cenhancement requirement\u201d was understood as a critical requirement, there was no specific mandate in the ESA categorically banning trophy imports that do not provide a net benefit to the species. Therefore, it was the USFWS\u2019s interpretation of the ESA that justified its policy to prohibit such imports and ban elephant trophy imports. This decision further involves the weighing of future conservation efforts because of trophy hunting, invoking a forward-looking, policy-oriented judgment as it weights future conservation efforts driven by future trophy hunting; prospective by nature and characteristic of rulemaking under the APA. Finally, the decision set a precedent for all future trophy imports, making it \u201capplicable across the board\u201d and \u201cgeneralized in nature\u201d, consistent with the rulemaking definition under the APA. We conclude the ruling of the USFWS decision as rulemaking is consistent with the APA.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA comparison of the USFWS\u2019s trophy import ban in Safari with the FDA\u2019s delisting action then shows marked differences between the two, leading to the conclusion that the delisting action falls under informal adjudication. First and foremost, while USFWS made a prospective policy decision on future conservation and trophy hunting outcomes, and FDA\u2019s decision is fundamentally a factual decision based on current supply and demand dynamics. There is no prospective aspect related to the decision; the FDA\u2019s application of past data to existing drug shortage and compounding law to determine \u201ccurrent rights and liabilities\u201d is more consistent with adjudication under the APA. Furthermore, while the USFWS decision set precedence and created new policy applicable to all future trophy imports, the FDA\u2019s delisting directly alters current legal rights of compounders already outlined in existing legislation; no new, broad policy was created in the delisting process. Future drug shortages will still be determined by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. Again, this is consistent with adjudication under the APA.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe most intuitive argument is Perez vb. Mortg. Bankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 101 (2015), which states that the APA \u201cmandate\\[s\\] that agencies use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used to issue the rule in the first instance\u201d. Under the assumption that the delisting consisted of rulemaking, Perez guides that since the FDA did not engage in notice-and-comment when it listed Tirzepatide on the shortage list, it is not obligated to do so for the delisting.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe most convincing argument against Plaintiffs use of Safari Club is Vanda Pharms., Inc. v. FDA, 436 F. Supp. 3d 256, 270 n.4 (D.D.C. 2020), which rejected the argument that FDA\u2019s analysis of scientific literature in an adjudication applied to future cases such that it was a legislative rule, and noting that, unlike in Safari Club, the agency\u2019s analysis was \u201cin the context of adjudicating a particular set of disputed facts\u201d. Essentially, Vanda established that determinations of shortage status fit under adjudication of disputed facts.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe other core part of Plaintiff\u2019s arguments is how \u201c\\[t\\]he existence of a dispute concerning particular individuals is a distinguishing characteristic of adjudication.\u201d McDonald v. Watt, 653 F.2d 1035, 1042 (5th Cir. 1981). The key here is whether Tirzepatide compounders in general can be classified as \u201cparticular individuals\u201d. The FDA convincingly parries this argument using City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, 668 F.3d 229, 243 (5th Cir. 2012); Qwest Servs. Corp. v. FCC, 509 F.3d 531, 536\u201337 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The FDA argues that its delisting fits under a \u201cdeclaratory order\u201d, a type of adjudication which \u201c\\[has\\] binding legal effect and allow agencies to efficiently apply existing policy to a set of facts without the need for any particular party to risk penalty or sanction to resolve a dispute\u201d (FDA Opposition to PI, Case Doc 97, 2/20).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWeighing all the submitted records and arguments, the \u201csubstantial ink\u201d the OFA has spilled \"arguing that FDA should have engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking\u201d (LLY Memo of Law in Opposition to PI Motion, Case Doc 89, 2/18) is exactly that \u2013 the odds are strongly against the OFA. We conclude that not only is the motion for preliminary injunction will likely not be granted by Judge Pittman, a non-zero probability exists for the injunction to be moot entirely should the entire case be decided within the month of March, before the compounding deadline of March 19^(th) set by the FDA.\u00a0\n\nSensitivity Analysis for OFA v. FDA (LLY)\u00a0\n\nLike the case itself, the implications for LLY depending on different ruling results are equally complex. To simplify, we designate two potential outcomes for LLY:\u00a0\n\n1. Courts grant motion for PI. Whether FDA/LLY appeals, compounders have another \\~6 months of legal compounding. We assign a \\~20% probability to this scenario. Stock trades down \\~0-3%, as the downside risk is the status quo, which we believe to be mostly priced into the stock (based on12/19 price action)\u00a0\n2. Courts deny motion for PI, or the PI is moot and the Judge rules in favor of FDA/LLY. Deadline of March 19^(th) becomes the effective end date of all legal compounding as the case plays out. We assign a \\~80% probability to this scenario. Stock trades up \\~5-10%, based on our SOTP valuation of LLY below in which we attribute around \\~75% of LLY market cap to its ex-Orfor GLP1 business, as well as our estimation of the GLP1 compounding market size to be \\~20-30% of the total GLP1 market (below).\u00a0\n\nWe view OFA v. FDA risks as mostly to the upside. While LLY supply capacity is a key area of focus, any de-risking of uncertainty around compounding is likely to benefit LLY. Quantitatively, we estimate the market compounders are currently capturing that will largely move under LLY\u2019s column under a positive ruling.\u00a0\n\n# Catalyst 2: Orforglipron Phase 3 ACHIEVE-1 Data\u00a0\n\nOrforglipron (Orfor) is an oral GLP1 agonist with potential to transform the diabetes and obesity market. Expected to reach market \\~2 years before any competitor orals, LLY will enjoy significant first-to-market advantage and further dominant share if successful. Top-line data from multiple Phase 3 (Ph3) trials are expected this year for Orfor, beginning with ACHIEVE-1 in April, which focuses on Orfor for patients with Type-2 Diabetes (T2D) (study [here](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05971940#study-plan)). The key metrics to focus on for the study are the:\u00a0\n\n1. Weight loss percentage: target of >7%, which implies weight loss for non-T2D obesity patients in the mid-teens, based on Tirzepatide T2D/Obesity comparison\u00a0\n2. Discontinuation rate, specifically due to adverse effects (AEs): target of <10%\u00a0\n3. HbA1C lowering profile (): target of >1.5%, which implies effectiveness in controlling blood sugar levels for T2D patients\u00a0\n\nTable 1. Trial Results and Targets for Oral/Injectable GLP1s\u00a0\n\n|| || |\u00a0|Weight Loss\u00a0\u00a0|Discontinuation Rate (due to AEs)\u00a0|HbA1C Lowering Profile\u00a0\u00a0|Weeks (Total, Titration)\u00a0| |Orfor Ph2 (T2D)\u00a0|8.2%\u00a0|15%\u00a0|1.8%\u00a0|26 (2-6 weeks)\u00a0| |Orfor Ph3 Targets (T2D)\u00a0|>7%\u00a0|<10%\u00a0|>1.5%\u00a0|40 (16 weeks)\u00a0| |Tirzepatide Ph2 (T2D)\u00a0|9.7%\u00a0|25%\u00a0|1.8%\u00a0|26 (2-6 weeks)\u00a0| |Tirzepatide Ph3 (T2D)\u00a0|9.1%\u00a0|7%\u00a0|2.0% (later trials up to 2.5%)\u00a0|40 (20 weeks)\u00a0| |Rybelsus Ph2 (NVO Oral)\u00a0|7%\u00a0|12%\u00a0|1.8-2%\u00a0|52 (26 weeks)\u00a0|\n\nMost critical to Orfor Ph3 success is being able to outperform a weight loss percentage of 7% while maintaining a discontinuation rate lower than 10%. There is reason for investors to be confident in Orfor Ph3 data at least meeting expectations considering precedence with comparable Tirzepatide Ph2 and Ph3 trials. LLY management has indicated that increasing the titration period in Tirzepatide Ph3 trials helped reduce discontinuation rates from 25% to 7%; Orfor Ph3 sees a comparable increase in titration from 2-6 weeks to 16 weeks. Furthermore, strong HbA1C and weight loss percentages readings in Ph2 data has been a strong indicator of consistency in Ph3 trials as well; a 5% deviation from the Ph2 8.2% weight loss puts Ph3 well above our target of 7%.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAdditional confidence can be found in LLY management stockpiling a \u201cpre-launch inventory\u201d of over 550 MM worth of Orfor (article [here](https://www.tipranks.com/news/eli-lilly-lly-stockpiles-weight-loss-pill-ahead-of-regulatory-approval)) even before the first Ph3 trial data readout. The current stockpile would represent over 10 B in Orfor sales.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSensitivity Analysis for Orfor Ph3 ACHIEVE-1\u00a0\n\nLike the OFA v. FDA catalyst, the market reactions for Orfor Ph3 data in April will be complex and nuanced. To simplify, we model it with three most likely scenarios:\u00a0\n\n1. Beating expectations. Weight loss >7%, HbA1C reduction >1.5%, and discontinuation rate due to AEs <10%. We assign a 70% probability to this case. Stock trades up \\~5-10% as we shift to an Orfor bull-case in addition to de-risking.\u00a0\n2. Meeting expectations. Weight loss \\~5-6%, HbA1C reduction \\~1-1.5%, and discontinuation rate due to AEs >10%. We assign a 20% probability to this case. Stock trades even at around \\~0-3% due to de-risking of Orfor.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. Missing expectations/failure. We assign a 10% probability to this case. Stock trades down \\~5-10%.\u00a0\n\nWe assign stock movements for Orfor Ph3 based on our SOTP valuation for LLY below, in which we attribute around \\~10% of LLY market cap to the Orfor pipeline.\u00a0\n\n# LLY SOTP Valuation\u00a0\n\nTable 2. LLY SOTP Valuation at $930/share implying an enterprise value of \\~860B.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n|| || |Business\u00a0|Enterprise Value\u00a0|Percentage of EV\u00a0|Equity Price/Share\u00a0| |Ex-Obesity/Diabetes\u00a0|170 B\u00a0|20%\u00a0|186\u00a0| |Orforglipron\u00a0|90 B\u00a0|10%\u00a0|93\u00a0| |GLP1 Ex-Orfor\u00a0|600 B\u00a0|70%\u00a0|651\u00a0| |Total\u00a0|860 B\u00a0|100%\u00a0|930\u00a0|\n\nWe break down LLY into three key segments for our SOTP valuation:\u00a0\n\n1. Ex-obesity/diabetes. Excluding obesity and diabetes, LLY pipelines and drugs, such as Kisunla for early-stage Alzheimer's, are also promising. This segment represents around \\~57% of FY24 revenue and around \\~20% of the enterprise value.\u00a0\u00a0\n2. GLP1 Ex-Orfor. Excluding Orfor, we price LLY to have \\~60% of the total GLP1 market across biopharmaceutical companies.\u00a0 OFA v. FDA is the main catalyst for this segment of the business, which can increase the total market by \\~20-30%. A conservative projection of LLY capturing 60% share of a GLP1 compound market shrunk by \\~50-75% due to price-demand elasticity gives between an \\~8-15% increase in GLP1 Ex-Orfor segment valuation, reflecting a \\~5-10% increase in share price on the conservative end.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. Orfor segment. We estimate that the market currently prices Orfor at 90 B, which implies LLY capturing \\~60% of the oral GLP1 market by 2033 with 12 B in Orfor sales at a probability of success (POS) of 70%. With a Ph3 de-risking of Orfor POS to around \\~90%, Orfor segment valuation in the base-case increases by \\~30% or around 27 B EV, reflecting a \\~3% increase in share price. However, it also increases the probability of the bull case in which LLY captures upwards of 75% share in the oral GLP1 market, which would command at least a 175 B valuation assuming conservatively that total oral GLP1 market does not increase as well, adding 85 B EV, reflecting a \\~10% increase in share price.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n# Price Target \u2013 Catalyst-Adjusted Valuation\u00a0\u00a0\n\nGiven significant confidence ahead of market consensus in both Catalyst 1 and 2 being positive for LLY, we use our SOTP and sensitivity analysis to drive our price target:\u00a0\n\n1. Catalyst 1 gives \\~5-10% share price increase at a POS of 80%, \\~0-3% share price decreases at a POS of 20%, reflecting a probability weighted \\~5.7% price increase.\u00a0\n2. Catalyst 2 gives \\~10% share price increase at a POS of 70%, a \\~3% share price increase at a POS of 20%, and a \\~10% share price decrease at a POS of 10%, reflecting a probability weighted \\~6.6% price increase\u00a0\n\nCombining these two catalysts, we derive a base-case upside of \\~12.5% for LLY, with a bull-case upside of \\~21%, reflecting a base-case PT of $1046 and a bull-case PT of $1135. We derive the bull case using a POS of 100% for both Catalyst 1 and 2.\u00a0\n\n# Other Considerations\u00a0\n\nGiven the current regulatory environment and political landscape, it would be imprudent to not address sector and market risks impacting LLY. Fortunately for LLY, their business and sector are not at the center of any significant prospective tariffs, making biotechnology relatively attractive from a market-risk perspective. Healthcare and biotechnology have been traditionally defensive plays during times of uncertainty, reflected in LLY\u2019s 0.47 beta despite its high valuation. A cursory comparison of the movements of LLY and the broader market in the past 1-2 weeks will demonstrate the low-beta nature of LLY. In fact, I believe a 0.47 beta overstates LLY\u2019s exposure to market risks.\u00a0\n\nThe pharmaceutical tariff of 25% as the Trump administration has floated would certainly impact LLY. However, LLY is also investing significantly (50 B pledged) in domestic manufacturing, and North American currently represents \\~73% of their total revenue. CEO David Ricks cites regulatory tailwinds, such as additional tax cuts on the 2017 Trump Tax Cut, as main motivators for the 50 B investment in the US. As a result, it is unclear whether the Trump administration will be a net benefit or detriment to LLY.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLone Pine Capital\u00a0\n\nAs an interesting aside, Stephen Mandel\u2019s Lone Pine Capital, a hedge fund with both a Long Only and Long/Short arm, added a new, sizable position in LLY in 4Q24 according to their 13F filing [here](https://13f.info/13f/000090266425001072-lone-pine-capital-llc-q4-2024), and more clearly visualized [here](https://hedgefollow.com/funds/Lone+Pine+Capital). A long position of 782k shares at an average price of 828/share representing a position of 604 MM and 4.5% of their total portfolio indicates confidence in the company.\u00a0\n\n# Constructing the Trade\u00a0\n\nGiven our bullish stance on two significant catalysts in the upcoming \\~1-2 months, we position ourselves long with slightly OTM May25 1000c calls at \\~27 for maximum exposure to these catalysts. If we hold until expiry, the base-case PT of 1046 and the bull-case PT of 1135 represent a \\~72% and \\~405% return, respectively.\u00a0\n\nMy LLY Positions\u00a0\n\n[Positions from 3\\/3 - LLY down today to \\~910](https://preview.redd.it/4ce3n0cvstme1.png?width=1141&format=png&auto=webp&s=277bb0046528663948efd66c915953ba8f664956)\n\n\u00a0",

Chinese networks crumble daily under the traffic, once people start working in their offices.\n\nAs for the housing market I\u00b4d even go for a lottery scheme. The state buys up large amounts of empty apartments and offers them as wins in a lottery. The lottery pays for itself, while the market becomes less crowded and more active. The main problem would be the upfront costs. \n\nNow some of these ideas may very well seem ridiculous, but the point is: If you want to infuse an economy and are willing to spend the dime, there are ways. Beijing would have to be careful to make the result not to lopsided to cause the europeans to follow Trumps example, but instead use it to lure european investment back.\n\nIn the end the trade wars will still hurt everybody, but the more other countries are willing to engage in trade with each other, the less impact the tariffs will have outside the US.",

Anyone who touched the sector was immediately sent to baggy land. The $MJUS ETF got delisted, market caps down 90%+, the AUMs of cannabis funds sliding to zero, there's zero investor confidence.\n\nLook at that shit stain of a chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t327lusxasme1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=48ab666c7b4de79cc30c7f58738dcb2a15b8090d\n\nGuh\n\nAnyone around in 2021 was familiar with the cannabis bull run. Stinky stoner teens in their moms' basements tossing their stimmy checks at shit like Tilray. It was all garbage. Everyone knew it, but the bet was federal legalization would bake in all the hype valuation.\n\nAfter \ud83e\udd6dleft in 2020, weed bulls were hype for \u267f. Biden hit the office in 2021 and made it clear he didn't care about federal legalization. Efforts in congress grinded to a halt. Momentum faded and so did the share price.\n\nWishful thinking slapped the hand of dipshit trendfollowing retail yet again (I see you, $PLTR baggy!), and has seriously punished anyone holding cannabis over the last 4 years.\n\nBut of course, where there's enough blood in the water, you buy.\n\n$CNBS is basically the last way to get broad exposure to US weed stocks now. All the other ETFs died. Here's what they hold.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nm631kpobsme1.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d67edb3fc075fe0d3f03e08f90f6281d022d766\n\nAnd honestly, the valuations on these companies look **really fucking attractive** now.\n\nLet's crack open Green Thumb, 1.6B market cap.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ssem3fzvbsme1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=77242229227d439e25bd3e6eb3f2a92c1c5a9d6a\n\nShare price down 90%+ has led to the company trading for \\~7x operating income.\n\nYou also get $711M of tangible book value. That's basically half the market cap.\n\nOf course, management for all these cannabis stocks were busy smoking the product in 2020-2022 and decided to acquire a bunch of shit for way more than they should have. This has inflated their goodwill on the balance sheet substantially, but their return on tangible assets is actually really good.\n\nYou can calculate the Buffett Return (similar to ROIC/ROA) to get an idea of how they are pushing income on their assets:\n\n**Buffett-style Return Calculation:**\n\n* Buffett-style Return = Owner Earnings / (Inventory + PP&E)\n* Buffett-style Return = $245,012,000 / $550,163,000\n* Buffett-style Return \u2248 0.445 or 44.5%\n\nGreen Thumb looks super attractive **at today's sales and revenue, assuming ZERO growth.**  Their return is quite high, you're getting the business with substantial tangible book value, and at a single digit multiple to operating income. What else could you ask for?\n\nThat is the recurring thesis you will see with these holdings, that pessimism has peaked to the point that **weed could never be federally legal, no future states could choose to legalize, and the valuations here still make sense.**\n\nLet's move to holding #2 Trulieve\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mryat9i7fsme1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f3e16d1016893fbee1989aea72d2811d36ccdd4\n\nStinky EBITDA after taxes.\n\nWhat sucks about this industry is that the tax bills are massive. They're against the revenue and not the operating income of the business, so there's no real way to avoid them. They're also really, really high. But, it doesn't make Trulieve uninvestible.\n\nAt 775M market cap, Trulieve has 487M in tangible book value, about 2/3 of the market cap. That's a wild margin of safety. COGS and OPEX are also decreasing significantly. It looks like their gross margins are substantially increasing though. The stock looks pretty cheap at \\~4X EBITDA. Even if we use their shitty EBITDA-Taxes, they're trading at \\~7x the 3 year average.\n\nFinally, I want to look at Curaleaf.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/by7x70h2jsme1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=4342887167ea0fa5d5d1ba792459fae65266c375\n\nBeautiful profitability and steady with the revenue while increasing their margins. Always great to see.\n\nAt 780M market cap, Curaleaf actually has negative tangible book value of 800M. But you're paying 780M market cap for an amazing reason. The company is trading for about 4X cash flow, easily the best value proposition on an income multiple.\n\n**My position:**\n\nI am currently holding 500 shares long of $CNBS for around $10,000.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pny1ljdejsme1.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e21b417618d101699f7deb0d64d276a5c5bc52\n\nI believe the tariff talk has caught these stocks in an unintentional crossfire considering the close Canadian ties. Obviously the chart technicals don't help.\n\nHonestly, I'm bias towards buying deep value situations under deep investor pessimism. It's [how I made my bags on $BABA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h55bbd/china_bad_baba_good_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) which is up over 50% in the past 3 months since posting. These situations where investor emotions are clouding business fundamentals are my bread and butter, and hopefully some people here see the value as well.\n\nI'm comfortable holding a relatively small position in Cannabis. If we don't get legalization, these bets are placed at fair value for their current operations. If we do get legalization in more states, or federal legalization, you know exactly what these stocks are doing. Up, up, up, but downside here is very muted. Asymmetrical risk at its finest.\n\nTL;DR: Buy weed stocks, they're cheap, sentiment is horrible, can't really get worse from here. $CNBS",

The policy aims to attract investors and drive local blockchain development. By omitting tax requirements, the administration hopes to make the crypto market more appealing and boost participants, who, through their combined activities, could drive significant financial growth. Nothing about the details of the proposal, however, was disclosed, leaving a lot of questions.\n\nThe proposal suggests that overseas-based crypto projects would be taxed higher, therefore providing a competitive advantage to U.S.-based projects. This differentiation would attract foreign projects to relocate to the United States, which would further solidify it as a blockchain hub. Critics are of the view that such a policy might lead to market distortions and loss of revenue for the government.

        "title": "Teekay Tankers (TNK): The Hidden Winner of the Tariff War",
        "text": "Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK) stands to benefit from the current trade dynamics and longer-term geopolitical shifts, potentially making it a compelling investment in today's volatile market.\n\n# Short-Term Catalyst: Tariffs and Trade Route Changes\n\nWith the U.S. imposing tariffs (10-20%) on Canadian crude imports, Canadian producers will likely begin exploring alternative markets. While the U.S. remains Canada's primary customer, higher costs could temporarily push some oil onto tankers headed for overseas markets, particularly in Asia and Europe. Increased tanker traffic means longer shipping distances and higher daily charter rates, directly benefiting tanker companies like Teekay Tankers. One of the reasons why the oil is tariffed less than other goods is to ensure that the tariff is just high enough to put it on the edge of shipping oil to other refineries, but this is just the short term catalyst. Shipping oil to an overseas refinery will add about 10% to the cost of the finished product which means the oil won't immediately flow overseas, but it will start. With Europe still heavily sanctioning Russia and Canada/Mexico being heavily tariffed, new trade routes will be utilized over the coming months. However, this is just a short term catalyst.\n\n# Long-Term Catalyst: Potential Return of Russian Oil Imports\n\nIf the US rolls over and sanctions are lifted against Russa, Russian crude shipments to the U.S. would resume, significantly increasing tanker demand. Russian crude, such as Urals blend, transported from Russian ports to the U.S. Gulf Coast or East Coast refineries, would generate higher tanker utilization rates, boosting Teekay's revenues substantially. Per barrel it would probably cost >8$ to ship from Russia to the Gulf Coast refineries which at current oil prices is roughly around 10% (equal to Trumps tariffs). This makes it economically viable for Russia to sell Ural oil to the United States, not to mention that since they've been sanctioned for so long they are probably just bursting to sell some non-dark-shipped oil to the global market.\n\nNot to mention that in this scenario Canada would also likely start shipping more oil overseas. The trade routes will be absolutely wonky. Russia shipping to the USA, Canada shipping to Europe.\n\n# Financial Health & Valuation\n\nTeekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK) is currently trading below its book value, offering investors an appealing valuation. In a recession where inflation will be an issue it's often recommended to trade in commodities because they hold their value while everything else loses value to inflation or just loses value straight up. You know what doesn't lose value? Capital assets in a growing sector. TNK owns their ships outright and is currently trading at less than their fleet value (which is normal for a shipping company). It's a safe haven AND a growth sector:\n\n* **Fleet Asset Value:**\u00a0Approximately $1.548 billion\n* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**\u00a0Extremely low at \\~0.03, minimal debt concerns\n* **Market Cap vs. Asset Value:**\u00a0Currently trading below book value, TNK offers a compelling valuation opportunity.E\n\n# The Win-Win Scenario\n\n* **Short-term:**\u00a0Trade tariffs disrupt established North American crude logistics, increasing tanker demand.\n* **Long-term:**\u00a0Potential reopening of Russian crude routes to the U.S. market significantly expands TNK's long-haul demand, further elevating long-term profitability.\n\n# Investment Thesis:\n\n* **Near-term upside:**\u00a0Immediate tanker rate boosts due to trade disruptions.\n* **Long-term potential:**\u00a0Major upside from resuming Russian crude imports.\n* **Financially attractive:**\u00a0Trading below book value with minimal debt risk.\n\nGiven this scenario,\u00a0**Teekay Tankers (TNK)**\u00a0offers an attractive risk-reward profile while the rest of the market dumps, expect TNK to offer a safe haven & growth. Investors looking for a sector-specific play during geopolitical disruptions should seriously consider this undervalued tanker operator.\n\nPositions- 1600 shares at 37 ish -  Picked up this morning.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ly4ucd2oupme1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15df266b4e373e83d12c30e898ff1961d56cef33\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jj0ume2oupme1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5676dce9669d0d92032fd42b50facf00f50f060\n\n",

However, I've been trading it for the past 6 years and made a ton of money doing so. Why? Because bitcoin ALWAYS pumps off of any catalyst. $MSTR is a stock that holds bitcoin and is a way to buy call options and make a ton of money off it's moves.\n\nOver the weekend CNBC announced on Friday this week the White House is hosting it's first ever Bitcoin Summit and they are going to lay out the ground work for a Bitcoin Reserve and Trump is going to speak about the future of crypto. The most obvious play is \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" going into this event. All bitcoin holders have been waiting since the election to find out more about the Bitcoin Reserve and that's all they care about. $MSTR has been meeting with Trump and the administration and will be one of the leaders in this effort. Now that the tariffs finally hit I believe $MSTR OTM calls are an easy 50 bagger and it will go back to the $300 level it ALREADY hit yesterday and higher going into Fridays event.\n\nEdit 1: Around 12 PM today it was announced CEO of $MSTR (Micahel Saylor) will be joining the Crypto event on Friday at the White House with Trump \n\nPositions are Shares and $260, $280 and $300 weekly calls.

        "title": "[DD] Critical Minerals II: The Domestic Supply Chain Strikes Back",
        "text": "Hi all, this is meant to be a followup to the last \\[DD\\][ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/). The thesis of that post was:\n\n>**Thesis/Summary:** the mining industry presents a massive opportunity anywhere from right now to the end of the present US administration and hopefully beyond. The investments that will matter most have to do with the processing, extraction, separation, and manufacturing of titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals deemed critical. These investments must be allied with western interests, ideally operating in the United States. The issue that is most relevant is the complete market dominance China has over these metals and rare earth minerals.\n\nIn this post, I want to go over further developments in my research on this sector and the subsequent adjustments that I\u2019ve made to my portfolio as a result.\u00a0 I\u2019ll start with a bit of methodology. Among the guiding considerations I have found reasonable:\n\n1. Priority should be given to domestic companies looking to mine, refine, and develop critical metals/minerals in the USA or who may be substantial suppliers of our critical minerals stockpile. Secondary priority should be given to companies that are part of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or otherwise western-aligned, and wishing to mine, refine, or develop critical metals/minerals in the USA, or who may be stockpile suppliers.\n2. Priority should be given to companies that have substantial federal contracts already or have projects presently awaiting government permits, funding, or regulative actions, where such action would be expressly in the USA national security interest.\n3. Priority should be given to companies that have institutionally and politically well-resourced members involved in their board, leadership, governing body.\n4. Priority should be given to companies represented unusually strongly in the portfolio of major hedge funds, have unusual levels of insider activity, and/or are represented in the financial disclosures of politicians in Washington, D.C.\u00a0\n5. Priority should be given to companies that have established they can deliver results or who have a head start in their particular niche of the industry relative to competitors.\n\nGiven this, a lot of my research has presently been focused on evaluating degrees of institutional, political, and insider support for the companies that, *prima facie,* appear to have their interests aligned with the federal government in that the success of the company supports federal objectives.\n\nSpecifically, here is what I have done since last writing:\n\n1. I combed through the 2024 financial disclosures of the administration and his various cabinet members to evaluate whether they had considerable equity in this sector and, if so, where.\n2. I combed through 13F and NPORT filings from the heavy-hitting hedge funds, investment managers, and so on (e.g. Blackrock, Citadel, \u2026) to evaluate their posturing.\n3. I did research into which companies work with which metals/minerals and where, if any, there are bottlenecks in their growth that may be eased w/ deregulation, federal support.\n4. I looked into which individuals, with ties to the mining and metals industry, appear to also be tied to, or otherwise cozy with, the president, or members of his administration. I then looked into their financial disclosures, etc, as well, at least to the extent possible.\n5. Wherever I found an investment firm, LLC, etc, that I did not recognize, but which has been making substantial recent investments in this sector and in the companies I have flagged, I went on to also research who was behind them and their affiliations.\n\nStrategies like this can be hampered by the delay between position adjustments and submission of financial disclosures. Hence, this does have its risks. Nonetheless, I found interesting data. For example, when I was looking into MP materials, I noticed substantial **($200 million+)** investments opened Q4 2024 (that is, as of December 31, 2024)\u00a0 by \u201cHancock Prospecting Pty.\u201d I also noticed the fund was **$2billion+ in total.** I had never heard of this group.\u00a0 Did a little looking into it and it turns out to be managed by [**Gina Rinehart**](https://www.hancockprospecting.com.au/gina-rinehart-revealed-as-owner-of-2b-us-stock-portfolio/)**,** a mining magnate and Australia\u2019s richest person, who also happens to be close enough with Mangoes hat [she attended his inauguration party in January](https://www.atlasiron.com.au/pratt-rinehart-to-attend-trumps-inauguration/), alongside the usual cabal of tech billionaires and politicians. Look at this[ adorable photo of her](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/be-like-donald-trump-gina-rinehart-tells-nations-leaders/news-story/86084df17ee039ba0c4c963d1be45256?amp) with Argentina\u2019s president, Javier Milei, who also attended.\n\nAs I said, in Q4 2024, Rinehart\u2019s fund opened substantial new positions, including $200million+ in MP materials. Of the investments I listed in my last research post, the fund also opened up new positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars in TSLA, ALB, others...\n\nI also learned in this past research cycle that the president has investments in companies like UUUU and CAT, that Kash Patel has investments in MP materials and CAT, and that Ken Griffins (Citadel) increased his share in MP materials by 2500% in Q4 (albeit, he also shifted his derivatives b/w the long Call/Put spread he likes to keep on many of his holdings).\n\n[**John Paulson**,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-05/election-2024-john-paulson-is-raising-43-million-for-trump) a close friend and billionaire supporter of the president, who is perhaps most famous for his bet against the housing market in 2008, which made him $20 billion richer, also has investments in PPTA (Perpetua Resources).\n\nII. My Positions and Investments\n\nThe following is a rank-order list of ten companies that I am presently invested in or investing in and which have met markers for success as canvassed in this and the previous DD.\n\n1. MP Materials: Heavy Rare Earth Mining, Processing, Magnets\n2. USA Rare Earth: Heavy Rare Earth Mining, Processing, Magnets + Gallium\n3. UUUU (Energy Fuels): Uranium and Titanium\n4. Lithium Americas: Lithium/batteries\n5. CAT: Construction Equipment\u00a0 / Infrastructure\n6. IPX: Titanium\n7. ABAT: Lithium Battery & Recycling\n8. Ameri.

I am bullish $MP , more so than any other company primarily because it is the only miner/refiner/manufacturer of rare earths in western hemisphere. Litinsky is a legit leader.\n\nHere are a few other things to consider\n\n1. Interesting comments by U.S. Interior Secretary on 03/12 to energy executives in Houston. Tells what is coming as a part of Trump executive order for critical minerals and rare earths. The US sovereign wealth fund could get involved in miners (see text in **bold**) U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told a packed room of energy executives on Wednesday that he wants their industries to ramp up drilling and mining on America\u2019s public lands, telling the crowd: \u201cWe love you!\u201d. Burgum\u2019s comments to the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston underscored the agenda of President Donald Trump, a Republican, to unfetter fossil fuels and metals production by slashing as much red tape as possible.\n\nBurgum added that the council is focused on boosting U.S. production of critical minerals, which include lithium and nickel. **He said the council has \u201creally big, really powerful\u201d ideas to boost U.S. mining, including using the planned U.S. sovereign wealth fund** and better coordinating with allies.\n\n**He did not directly say whether the wealth fund would invest in mines**, although he underscored the country\u2019s reliance on China, the dominant minerals processor globally.\n\n\u201cWe put ourselves in a position of incredible risk, where we\u2019ve allowed ourselves to have a major competitor control 80 percent of the processing for critical minerals,\u201d said Burgum.\n\n2. $MP is low float , highly shorted too. not that it is a meme stock but it could catch fire very quickly once it gets some volume.\n\n19.5M shares shorted, average daily volume varies and is between 2-3M shares\n\ntotal outstanding shares 163M, out of which insiders and large institutions hold almost 76% shares (source CNBC data), this leaves barely $40M available as free float. I think anyone shorting $MP is playing with fire",

Trump also referenced further action relevant to this sector coming within a week or so in his speech last night. Staying tuned ~",
            "Fantastic information. Thank you. I suspected the sovereign wealth fund would be involved, given guidance I\u2019ve seen from folks in the sector close to Trump. If you learn anything more, keep me posted. Will do the same. Can DM ~",

        "text": "**Disclaimer: I am the guy that bought JAN2027 32C x 490 and used ChatGPT to help write this article.  This article is meant to trigger a serious discussion on a possible play on the stock that I like. Further due diligence should be made by yourself before entering this trade.**\n\n\n\n[Dated screenshot of my positions as of last weekend](https://preview.redd.it/e1cc8cnb5ome1.png?width=1420&format=png&auto=webp&s=99201d7e9eef23580c08cc6e0d39cf7242528b35)\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n1. **Another Failed Privatization Attempt?**: Nordstrom\u2019s previous privatization at $50 per share in 2018 was rejected by the board, and the company\u2019s current financial performance shows a sharp decline, making such valuations unrealistic today. Having failed just 8 years ago at a much higher price, are they settling too low an amount and will shareholders vote against this privitization?\n2. **Tariffs on Mexican Goods**: The recent U.S.'s 25% tariff on Mexican imports creates a significant challenge for any Mexican entity trying to acquire Nordstrom, especially given the company\u2019s reliance on Mexican manufacturing.\n3. **Ryan Cohen\u2019s 4.2% Stake**: Cohen still holds a significant stake in Nordstrom, which could mean he's preparing for a potential strategic shift, sale, or restructuring.\n\n**1. Another Failed Privatization Attempt \u2013 Once bitten, Twice shy**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the history of Nordstrom (JWN) and a significant event that raised red flags for investors: the failed privatization attempt in 2018. The Nordstrom family made a bold attempt to take the company private at **$50 per share**, valuing the company at roughly **$8 billion**. This price point was based on optimism about the company\u2019s prospects, and it was underpinned by Nordstrom's relatively strong revenue at the time.\n\nThe failed acquisition at the $50 per share valuation is a major indicator that investors, including the Nordstrom family, were betting on a much brighter future. Given the company\u2019s current situation, a sale or acquisition at those former high prices may seem like a long shot now. The market sentiment, investor confidence, and Nordstrom\u2019s future outlook don\u2019t match the price tag that was set years ago. However given that they have also raised [FY24 outlook](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordstrom-raises-fy24-revenue-outlook-185200374.html) one ponders if the acquisition price tag of **$24.25/share** is a fair one and shareholders will vote against this price?\n\n**2. The 25% Tariff on Mexican Goods \u2013 A New Complication for Potential Acquirers**\n\nA major new development that could make any acquisition of Nordstrom even more complicated is the recent **25% tariff** imposed by the U.S. on all goods from Mexico. With Nordstrom having significant supply chains in Mexico \u2013 especially in terms of manufacturing and sourcing goods \u2013 these tariffs could have a substantial negative impact on the company\u2019s cost structure.\n\nAs many of Nordstrom's products come from Mexican manufacturers, these tariffs will result in **higher production costs**, potentially leading to **lower margins** or increased prices for consumers. This economic strain might make Nordstrom less appealing to potential acquirers, particularly those from Mexico. The potential acquirer **Liverpool,\u00a0S.A.B. de C.V.**\u00a0 said to have an interest in purchasing JWN, but these new tariffs complicate the calculus.\n\nGiven that the 25% tariff adds a layer of financial complexity, the attractiveness of a Nordstrom acquisition to a Mexican-based entity is highly diminished. These higher costs may force potential acquirers to either reprice their offers downward or back out of the deal entirely. This new trade barrier strengthens the likelihood that JWN could face prolonged struggles as its international market appeal is reduced.\n\n**3. Ryan Cohen\u2019s 4.2% Stake \u2013 A Wildcard in the Mix**\n\nAnother intriguing aspect to consider is **Ryan Cohen**, the **Chewy** co-founder and activist investor. Cohen has long been known for shaking up companies in which he invests. He holds a **4.2% stake** in Nordstrom,  although this stake does not give him a significant voice in the company\u2019s strategy. Cohen\u2019s involvement in JWN raises several questions. Is he planning to influence the company\u2019s direction or initiate changes that could lead to a potential sale? \n\nGiven his involvement in **a gaming company**, Cohen has proven that he is not afraid to make bold moves to alter the fate of a company. Whether that means pushing for a restructuring, a sale, or advocating for a shift in the company\u2019s strategic direction, Cohen\u2019s presence on the shareholder registry is worth watching closely.\n\nThe real question becomes: **How will Cohen leverage his position?** Is he trying to push for a sale of the company at a time when its valuation is low, but the market is volatile, and the company is struggling?",

It got made fun of by the entire AI influencer community.\n\nAnd this is supposed to be OpenAI's biggest model, so big that it's like 10x more expensive than other apis.\n\nIt might signal that's there's limits to scaling model sizes, which would slash forecasts on the number GPU's people are going to buy.\n\nCombine that with deepseek reaching great levels with much less compute, and that may signal that there is a limit of number of GPUs people need to reach the highest levels of AI.\n\nThoughts?",

            "I just think it's even more proof that reasoning models are the future, and they need waaaay more inference compute. Especially for very complex problems we're talking orders of magnitude more compute per query.\u00a0",
            "Position: NVDA bag holder. I own 160 shares and plan to buy maybe 100 more in the dip if it ever bottoms out. \n\nSo there was a particular scaling law which said basically if you double the size of the model, you get certain percentage improvement in a technical measure of how \"good\" the model is, called \"loss\". There is a similar law about how much improvement you get from doubling amount of training you do (number of tokens), which leads to a different percentage improvement, and the percentages multiply, so you can make a model better by making it bigger, training it for longer or both. There was an additional set of constraints about how to optimally trade off bigger data sets vs bigger models, basically saying you should have more data to train bigger models.\n\nThat's cool, but it turned out that getting models that were better on this technical measure (how well it predicts the next word) translated into actually better models. GPT-1 was a neat research project. GPT-2 was able to make vaguely interesting gibberish. GPT-3 could do things that were actually useful. GPT-4 could write functioning code and do some tasks better than the median college graduate, etc. Then it stopped at roughly that level for almost two years, with only incremental improvements since. \n\nFor NVDA, the \"scaling go brrr\" story was extremely bullish, since it implied that the maker of the fastest chips which could train the biggest models would achieve artificial super intelligence (ASI), which would be worth infinity dollars (in terms of discounted cash flows). So if NVDA could capture say 10% of that, and discounting by some percentage chance (say 50%) that they don't capture that cash stream, `0.1*0.5*infinity`=(believe it or not, calls).\n\nThis story had some potential pitfalls:\n1. Maybe the scaling laws would crap out. In other words, you train a bigger model and it doesn't actually get better at predicting the next word. \n2. Maybe the practical implications of predicting the next word slightly better would stop being important. The theory was that if your model was 99.9999% good at predicting the next word, eventually it could predict the next word from an Einstein paper and be as smart as Einstein. But maybe it could cheat by just getting better at predicting the words on WSB, without doing anything useful. \n3. Maybe they would run out of training data. The biggest models needed to be trained on something >10% as big as human-generated text on the internet, so 10Xing training data again wasn't an option.\n\nThe big concern last year was (3), but reasoning models have found a way around that (basically training the model on its own output, rewarding it for outputs that hit the right answer and punishing it for outputs that get the wrong answer). In that sense o1 and deepseek r1 were bullish for NVDA. It seems plausible that (1) hadn't become a problem, since AI labs tend to publish things which don't work, though it may be that scaling law has broken down. \n\nGPT-4.5 seems to speak to (2), where a technically better model doesn't seem to be practically better. A failure of (2) would imply that you maybe don't reach ASI, there's no infinities, and when you multiply regular numbers by fractions, they get smaller. Maybe \"scaling go brr\" is only worth $100T, and NVDA will only capture 10% of that it, and the best case has only a 10% chance of happening, so NVDA is only worth $1T plus some extra for the gaming business, your calls are worthless.\n\nAs to whether that's affecting the stock price currently, who tf knows. It made basically no sense for NVDA to tank on the deepseek news, or to creep back up to its previous value, or to tank after beating earnings estimates... There may not be a rational reason for the current price other than \"bulls ran out of hopium\".\n\nIf there is a reason it's continuing to tank, I suspect its current price is more reflective of worries about tariffs or a recession. Regardless of the effect of GPT4.5, a recession with tariffs and a global trade war will significantly curtail AI capex, reduce NVDA's margins and possibly hurt their production capacity.\n\nOne bullish note about GPT-4.5 that I think isn't widely appreciated... in the paper releasing o1, OpenAI introduced a new scaling law, where if they let the model use more tokens (basically think longer), they end up with better results, with 10x the tokens yielding a fixed percentage improvement in accuracy. This means that reasoning models have a dial you can crank to get more smarts. This has usually been interpreted as bad for NVDA since \"inference time compute\" is more competitive than \"training time compute\". (NVDA's comparative advantage is partly in their chips, but mostly in their software stack and integrated ultra-high-speed networking, which allows for efficient use of much more memory. Training is much more memory-intensive than inference, so NVDA's comparative advantage is bigger there.) However, that also means a slightly smarter model requires exponentially fewer tokens to get a given level of \"reasoning\" smartness, so differences that are harder to perceive in a single chat might be economically important. If that's the case, AI companies will need to keep training bigger  models, despite diminishing returns.",

        "title": "Next up for EU sovereignty: cloud computing",
        "text": "(resubmitted with positions)\n\n**TL;DR** If Europe continues to be serious about cutting ties with the USA, cloud computing will shift towards domestic options. There are only two clear publicly-traded choices, IOS and OVH. Many private companies also exist in this sector, but if there is a race for the EU everyone probably wins enough not to care.\n\nLong time lurker, first time poster. Glad for any constructive feedback and discussion. This is some fresh thinking so I expect there are serious holes in the logic, and there are definitely other sectors to consider.\n\nCurrent positions (on Interactive Brokers):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eyue7j78zime1.png?width=2871&format=png&auto=webp&s=19097cfd96335e00320b284f485b45c48fbd9f85\n\nThose of you tuned into the EU/USA relationship may have noted things are a bit interesting at the moment. For the past few years RHM would jump on any escalation of the Ukraine war, but after the latest American presidential inauguration basically every defense-related stock in Europe is going vertical. Some tickers and their change since January 20:\n\n* Rheinmetall (RHM) +70%\n* BAE Systems (BA) +30%\n* Leonardo (LDO) +80%\n* Thales (HO) +45%\n* Thyssen-Krupp (TKA) +150%\n* Dassault Systemes (DSY) +15%\n* MTU Aero Engines (MTX)  +4%\n* Hensoldt (HAG) +90%\n* Safran SA (SAF) +15%\n* Rolls Royce (RR) +35%\n\nFor additional picks check out this post from one of the German subreddits [\\[1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsGER/comments/1j1liny/ab_montag_alles_in_die_europ%C3%A4ische/)\n\nBut that is not the topic for today.\n\nToday we look into the future and see that Europe will realize that its entire compute infrastructure is essentially developed, owned, and operated by American companies. While the tech companies are not nationalized by the American government, the fact that reclusive billionaires who were mostly out of the game are coming back to assert that they will play ball (Sergey Brin calling for 60-hour work weeks...) suggests that something is going on in the background. People will become increasingly concerned about the potential for a widescale cyberattack comparable to Stuxnet, except that the target is the entire European economy rather than Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\nSo what can Europe and the EU do, apart from nothing?\n\nFirst, there is the option to reinforce existing legislation regarding privacy and security of data. The EU already effectively operates as a second Internet due to GDPR, which results in data processing happening in specific geographic regions (i.e. not USA) and users being allowed to refuse to certain types of data processing (e.g. cookie banners). As a consequence, cloud providers have options for noting exactly where data be stored, processed, or transmitted. That said, many US websites are simply not available in the EU due to a lack of desire to attempt to comply, including many news sites and certain home improvement stores. Adding new legislation could look something like ensuring that the compute infrastructure must be audited, that staff must be EU nationals, or something else which enables oversight on the supply chain a la the existing guidance [\\[2\\]](https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/guidelines/guidelines-use-cloud-computing-services-european_en). I expect something to happen in this space, but mostly reactive and definitely too late.\n\nSecond, USA companies can fork their operations and sell off European assets to these new European entities. This would be a fairly disruptive shift given that the workers in different regions can have dramatically different skillsets and pay grades. For example, tech giants like Google would have to give up access to their cheap labor in Europe, where wages are typically not more than half of the Silicon Valley standard [\\[3\\]](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/google/salaries/software-engineer/locations/berlin-metropolitan-region?dma=10025). This can be a motivating factor for the push towards automation of knowledge work as a whole: just as outsourcing software development from EU to Ukraine was disrupted by the war, so too would be American outsourcing to Europe if the US-Russia/EU conflict escalates.\n\nThird, EU companies (and elsewhere) can choose to move off of AWS, Azure, and GCP onto EU equivalents. Which brings us to the point: what are the European cloud computing companies that we can invest in?\n\nIf we dig through the database of European alternatives for cloud computing [\\[4\\]](https://european-alternatives.eu/category/cloud-computing-platforms), things are a bit dire. After all, Europe basically did not develop a real software infrastructure and barely has an understanding of the associated mindset, so most of these services seem to be technically sound but small. Plus, many companies (e.g. Hetzner) are built in the German Mittelstand style of close private ownership and thus we have no easy access for investment.\n\nIf we are to look at an ideal option for investment we should consider the following:\n\n* The first movers will likely be security- and stability-minded because that is what motivates them to be proactive. They are likely to put up with rough edges in the short term in exchange for the bare-metal ownership, and thus will likely target companies with resilient hosting of both compute and data (e.g. automatic replication in distinct geographies). I expect many firms in defense and finance are already considering or have already implemented these plans.\n* The big wave of movers will likely focus on reactive migration of existing services. They may have considered migrating but have not executed on it out of either caution, a lack of initiative, or simply a last of a sense of urgency. Some large event will scare them into action and thus their priority will be on wholesale rapid migration of their existing systems to the EU, as quickly as possible and essentially without consideration of cost. The winner here will either be the big firm which everyone knows is not wrong (does not yet exist) or the one with the smoothest sales onboarding and experience. Think back to uptake of Zoom during the pandemic versus all of the also-rans (Blue Jeans, Jitsi, GoToMeeting, Skype, Teams, Google Meet, Cisco...). If you are sitting there panicked by the scope of the work but are greeted with a friendly and reassuring interface, you can make it work and you will not care about the price tag. So, a good migration user experience will triumph over a good developer experience in the mid term. During this period, price gouging may happen but likely will be monitored by the EU to some extent.\n* After that wave of migration, developers may start to complain enough that the developer experience becomes important, and the European frugality will drive prices down. This phase is more about the 5-year picture and may be disrupted by the sheer volume of people on the platform that won in the short term.\n* Finally, hardware supply chains will come under scrutiny but in general it will be decided that it is too expensive to rip out existing systems except in the most clearly critical systems. This is probably a mistake from a security perspective but the line has to be drawn somewhere. That said, if companies like Visa or Mastercard come under scrutiny and get kicked out of Europe then all bets are off.\n\nCatalysts to consider:\n\n* Everyone finally decides to act on the fact that the USA has already de facto decided to leave NATO and the UN, leading to increased pro-European action\n* A cyberattack against European or American infrastructure occurs, leading to sanctions\n* China invades Taiwan, threatening the hardware supply chain\n* USA withdraws troops from some or all of its territories in Europe, threatening the USD\n* Russia invades a NATO country, possibly one of the Baltics\n\nSo we are looking for companies with as close to a 1-to-1 mapping of existing cloud features as possible, which are already established across Europe, and which have a good interface for migration from other platforms. Digging through a list of European alternatives [\\[4\\]](https://european-alternatives.eu/category/cloud-computing-platforms) we find exactly two publicly traded options: Ionos (IOS) and OVH Group S.A. (OVH). I also looked at Aruba S.p.A., Cyso Hosting BV, Elastx, Exoscale (owned by A1), gridscale GmbH (owned by OVHcloud), Hetzner Online GmbH, Open Telekom Cloud (owned by T-Systems International GmbH), Seeweb s.r.l., and STACKIT GmbH & Co. KG, but all of these are private and most are small.\n\nThis as a searing indictment of the European software scene and of the public markets here as a whole.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1331yfk9zime1.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=275ff950f6a61851862761d0587592e8720f8c25\n\nFirst up, **Ionos Group SE (IOS)**, market cap 3.5B. They had 1.5B in revenue in 2024 (10% annual growth) with 4100 employees. These guys went public in 2023-02 and are up about 60% since then. Their website is slick enough and hides the dirty details that might scare the casual browser (APIs, SDKs, and related developer documentation). Migration services do seem to exist. At the surface this seems like the people I would try to at minimum get a solid sales call with.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xamaygmazime1.png?width=2019&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd0acae30fe6463df281e7884eb94f5da178c1a\n\nSecond, **OVHcloud (OVH)**, market cap 1.8B. They had 1.2B in revenue in 2024 with 2900 employees. You may know them from the fire they had a few years back [\\[5\\]](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/ovhcloud-fire-france-data-center/). They have a good range of services but it is not clear that cloud migration is one of them. Stock performance is not great (down 70% since the start of 2022) but we're looking for value here and it seems that they have only just become profitable this past year (see [\\[6\\]](https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/sites/default/files/2025-01/ovhcloud-2024.11-plaquette-vdef-eng.pdf) and [\\[7\\]](https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/sites/default/files/2023-11/2023.08_-_ovh_groupe_-_plaquette_-_eng_-_vdef.pdf)). As a potential customer I would talk with this team but it would feel a bit uphill to get through to the migration specialists.\n\nSo, where to go from here? I took a small position in both IOS and OVH to get a bit of skin in the game. Both seem to be profitable companies with reasonable growth trajectories. The next phase of DD will be to do a bit of networking and see where sentiment is pushing. If this goes the same way as the defense sector I expect that all cloud companies will see a sharp uptick in sales and valuation, so I would balance holdings across the sector for now rather than picking a winner. Though calling two public companies a \"sector\" is a bit generous.\n\nIf the sovereignty logic seems sound to you, then consider analysis of the following sectors:\n\n* Financial infrastructure. Mastercard is already on the radar of the European Commission [\\[8\\]](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_19_582), and a pro-Europe movement could see Visa and Mastercard as threats\n* Computing hardware. While Europe is home to ASML, hardware design firms and fabrication facilities are not as prominent, though places like imec do exist. There is already precedent for additional spending here [\\[9\\]](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/growth/items/46654/) and TSMC is building a facility in Dresden, Germany [\\[10\\]](https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/3169)\n* Intelligence. Where is the European Palantir?\n* Petrochemicals. An escalation of conflict with the USA could interrupt trade and result in Europe looking to Norway or Saudi Arabia to improve access.\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsGER/comments/1j1liny/ab\\_montag\\_alles\\_in\\_die\\_europ%C3%A4ische/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsGER/comments/1j1liny/ab_montag_alles_in_die_europ%C3%A4ische/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/guidelines/guidelines-use-cloud-computing-services-european\\_en](https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/guidelines/guidelines-use-cloud-computing-services-european_en)\n\n\\[3\\] [https://www.levels.fyi/companies/google/salaries/software-engineer/locations/berlin-metropolitan-region?dma=10025](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/google/salaries/software-engineer/locations/berlin-metropolitan-region?dma=10025)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://european-alternatives.eu/category/cloud-computing-platforms](https://european-alternatives.eu/category/cloud-computing-platforms)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/ovhcloud-fire-france-data-center/](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/ovhcloud-fire-france-data-center/)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/sites/default/files/2025-01/ovhcloud-2024.11-plaquette-vdef-eng.pdf](https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/sites/default/files/2025-01/ovhcloud-2024.11-plaquette-vdef-eng.pdf)\n\n\\[7\\] [https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/sites/default/files/2023-11/2023.08\\_-\\_ovh\\_groupe\\_-\\_plaquette\\_-\\_eng\\_-\\_vdef.pdf](https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/sites/default/files/2023-11/2023.08_-_ovh_groupe_-_plaquette_-_eng_-_vdef.pdf)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip\\_19\\_582](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_19_582)\n\n\\[9\\] [https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/growth/items/46654/](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/growth/items/46654/)\n\n\\[10\\] [https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/3169](https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/3169)",

We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n\nhttps://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114093946326587357\n\nBut, there's no such language in the Executive Order, only language is about a stockpile from seized crypto by law enforcement agencies:\n\n>(c)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Working Group shall submit a report to the President, through the APEP, which shall recommend regulatory and legislative proposals that advance the policies established in this order.  In particular, the report shall focus on the following:\n(i)   The Working Group shall propose a Federal regulatory framework governing the issuance and operation of digital assets, including stablecoins, in the United States.  The Working Group\u2019s report shall consider provisions for market structure, oversight, consumer protection, and risk management.\n(ii)  **The Working Group shall evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile and propose criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts.**\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/\n\nThere's not a single mention of a strategic reserve in the EO.

            "What I get from that chart is that the standard deviation is wide enough for anything to happen in any month.",
            "Some of you degenerate regards introduced me to calendar anomalies, such as the concept of Septem-bear being a typically bad month. Naturally, I inversed r/wallstreetbets and my portfolio ripped. I've been having analyzing Fama-French data so I thought why not check out the calendar anomalies?\n\nI've included a series of violin plots, where the y-axis depicts the monthly return and the width of the violin depicts the frequency with which such returns are seen in that calendar month. Minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum returns are labeled. Additionally, black dots represent the top 5% of observations.\n\nOne notable finding from this graph is that the returns in November seem to be higher than they are in other months. Perhaps this is due to \"animal spirits\" surrounding the election? This was seen in the most recent cycle, in which equities pumped in November 2024 before being deflated over the last three months.\n\nTo better assess this, the next three graphs depict the same set of data, except for presidential election years only, for mid-term election years only, and for non-election years. It certainly seems like there's a more pronounced effect during election years (especially presidential elections), but November has historically been a stronger month even in non-election years.\n\nDisclaimer: don't YOLO your portfolio based on this, this is probably as regarded as technical analysis bullshit",

In this way it has a moat. \n\nAlso, it has a massive advantage over competitors as it is B2G first and then B2B second.

In hindsight, I should have waited until yesterday at open to close for a bigger profit but I just didn\u2019t feel 100% comfortable with how the market would react to earnings.\n\nYesterday wrote 40 80DTE NVDA 110 cash secured puts for $25k premium. Maximum loss if NVDA goes to 0 is $414.7k \n\nToday used the premiums (and an extra $2k) to buy 25 80DTE 125 calls (should have done this yesterday at close). NVDA has been 120-150 range bound for several months. I believe yesterday\u2019s 8% drop is an overreaction and NVDA will be in the 140 range in March. If im wrong, the calls were 90% paid by the premiums. Worst case scenario, this is basically a limit order for 4,000 shares of NVDA at $110.5 a share, and I\u2019m happy to hold onto NVDA at that price.",

With the market panic happening over tariffs, etc., I knew the hype wouldn't last long, as the market is very emotional.  Did some TA, and noticed that it was at local maximum that was an extreme outlier and starting to dip, so I took a chance.  There were other stocks in a similar scenario, but I did the math, and figured Airbnb had the best risk-reward ratio.  Consequently, I bought the puts for it on Feb 20th.\n\nShort answer: I got lucky, simple as.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mvtdaeuygame1.png?width=1204&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccb763cc7f458624702f6c49ecf963d184ed6e40",

        "title": "$DNUT: The Panic is Leaving me Glazed and Confused",
        "text": "Krispy Kreme (DNUT) has recently had it's donut hole pounded, with the stock declining over 30% this week following \"poor\" earnings and ratings downgrades. It is now hovering at an all-time low, and in the past year has declined from $17.84 (!!) to where it is now at \\~$6. I'm calling the bottom here, and will lay out why sprinkling some DNUT in your portfolio might make you Kreme your pants in a couple years.\n\n# The Cyber Incident in December\n\nOn Dec. 11, 2024, the company announced in an 8k filing that they have been hacked. Unauthorized activity on it's information systems disrupted online ordering, and in their Q4 earnings report announced that this resulted in a *material revenue loss of $11 million*. Hole-y shit. The good news is that the donut in IT who allowed this to happen is most likely terminated, and this should be seen as a one off incident.\n\n# Q4 Earnings: Donut Worry, the Worst is Behind Us\n\nEven so, DNUT persisted and still managed to post their 18th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth, with yearly revenue at 1.65B, and quarterly revs 404m (Would have been 415m if they didn't get hacked). Sure, net revenue in the US declined, but that is also due to the sale of Insomnia Cookies by the company a ($57.4 million impact). Management is really focused on making their main brand bigger and better, so letting go of Insomnia makes sense. What doesn't make sense, is the downward guidance, with management believing 2025's Net Revenue to be around $1.55-$1.65 billion. To be blunt- this is sandbagged, and I am betting 2025 will return to the upward growth of past years thanks to a newer CEO taking significant action in making US businesses more capital light and restructuring management teams.\n\nPast DNUT Net Revenue:\n\n2021: $1.28B\n\n2022: $1.53B\n\n2023: $1.68B\n\n2024: $1.65B\n\n2025: Company guiding $1.55-1.65B? Nah... more like $1.81B if they grow \\~10% like previous years.. and here is why I think they will.\n\n# McDonald's: Donut Sleep on This Partnership\n\nDNUT rocketed last year on the news that they would start rolling out their product into McDonald's restaurants. So far, they are in 1,900 locations, but the CEO expects them to be in over 12,000 by the end of 2026. The math on these McDonuts is mind boggling. (Credit to White Brook Capital for pointing this out)\n\nPrice of a donut $1.60, McD commission 60% (total guess here but probably over estimating)\n\nKK net rev per donut $0.64 (minus McDonald\u2019s commission)\n\nAverage amount of McDonald's breakfast customers per day: 275 people\n\nWith an attach rate of 20%, \\~55 donuts will be sold each day\n\nNet rev per day $35.20, minus waste (donuts not sold) and delivery cost of $7 and $25 respectively= $3 net revenue a day which doesn\u2019t seem like much until you take into account that that is $22 per week, $95 per month, $284 per quarter\u2026 $1153 per year at each store.\n\n**If we are looking at 12,000 McDonald's in 2 years\u2026 that is $13,836,000 in profits each year from McDonalds alone.** And these are conservative estimates. Is your hole feeling glazed yet?! And imagine if they strike deals with other diabetes inducing restaurant chains!\n\nSeparately, Krispy Kreme donuts main points of access for consumers are at Target, Walmart, and grocery stores like Amazon/Safeway/Giant/Publix. I usually see these neat little stands when I walk in, and they are near the cash registers to ensure fatasses like myself buy them on an impulse.\n\n# International Growth: Raking in the Dough\n\nA big highlight from the recent earnings that I feel is being overlooked is that in the International segment, net revenue grew $7.4 million, or 5.7% and International organic revenue grew 7.8%. Why? Because the company is executing well in places like Japan and Germany, creating nearly 700 new point of access stores last year alone. I know from experience that Japanese people LOVE American food, they can't get enough of our KFC, cheeseburgers, and now apparently donuts. Their international growth also explains the company's 800m long term debt... but they need to spend to continue expanding and I think they are executing. The company expects leverage to trend towards 4.0x by year end 2025, which is not that concerning. Plus international markets are not effected by irrational fears of RFK Jr. somehow cracking down on donuts and junk food.\n\n# Keep it simple and \"Old Fashioned\"\n\nIn conclusion, don't over think this one. With a nearly 70% dip from yearly highs, ~~deez nuts~~ these donuts are on discount. This is a good, established product with a cult following and a dominating social media and online presence (over 1 billion impression last year). I have opened a small position that I will add more to overtime. I expect another small dip or two due to market volatility.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ors1z5bm4xle1.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=8205e2e042e176f88ef4f71dabcc51e0150eefb1",

            "* spx and qqq puts. \n\nAdding text here, on old reddit can't be fucked to switch to make a post. \n\nOpened these positions early this week expecting that the market would eventually react to the threat of tariffs and uncertainty in Washington due to mass layoffs. Did I probably sell these too early? Most likely\n\nWill look to re-enter this position with a smaller size in the coming days / weeks. I think we re-test and break through new lows IF tariffs are confirmed, but then again that's a big IF. Better to take the guaranteed gain right now. \n\nWe will have much more room to go down once tariffs are enacted and I believe that the impact of them will be so monumentally bad that even waiting for their confirmation will lead to excessive profits. \n\nMy biggest regret? Not buying a seat at this administration's table. Any regard with a phone and robinhood installed with $10-100k could turn that into hundreds of millions in a few months just being near the source of potentially market rattling information.",
