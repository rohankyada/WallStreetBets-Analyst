You are analyzing Reddit posts from r/wallstreetbets. For each post, extract ONLY THE MAIN stock ticker being discussed and assign a sentiment score. 
ONLY include real tickers, not fake ones. Also, only include REAL tickers that are actually mentioned in the post. 
NO company names, only tickers.
For example, if they are talking about "GDP", even if its a ticker, its not what the post is about. USE context to understand. 

Score meaning (now from -1.0 to 1.0):
-1.0: Very bearish (strongly negative)
-0.5: Somewhat bearish (mildly negative)
0.0: Neutral
0.5: Somewhat bullish (mildly positive)
1.0: Very bullish (strongly positive)

Return ONLY a JSON list with this exact format:
[
  {"post_id": "abc123", "ticker": "AAPL", "sentiment_score": 0.8},
  {"post_id": "def456", "ticker": "TSLA", "sentiment_score": -0.6}
]

If a post doesn't clearly mention a specific ticker, use "UNKNOWN" as the ticker value.
Only return ONE ticker per post - the most prominently discussed one.

Title: I just bought calls 32C Nordstrom. Found out their going through an acquisition at USD24 a share. Am I retarded and does Nana still love me?

Top Comments: Worst case scenario: the acquisition falls through, share price tanks, and your options expire worthless

Best case scenario: acquisition deal closes, shares are retired, and your options expire worthless 

Good luck! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Text: Keep coming at me.
Top Comments: I SPY a Wendy's employee of the month in March.
You're watching SPY like it's your ex's social media. Meanwhile, did you know the VIX is spiking? Volatility is the real party.

Title: 2025 off to a great start!
Text: Small losses, huge gains. All 0dte spy options. Ignore the stock gains, I did not know the way of wsb.
Top Comments: How does one just KNOW the direction spy will go. I seem to misjudge it nearly everyday
It works until it doesn't. 

See you at Wendy's next month.
The boring answer is that OP is just riding with the waves and getting off quickly, hence only an 8% gain on his 0dte SPYs as opposed to like 200% if he was pre-reading the directions

Title: This crap stock, almost got cut by it yesterday, bounced back Gain 8.5K
Text: 
Top Comments: Mara has given me both my biggest wins and biggest losses
ah making money on $MARA volatility, takes me back to 2021.

  
didn't expect nostalgia.

  
but yes, total turd of a company, basic evidence that the market is built on lies and unsustainable hype.
Stay away bro.  Management kills every significant upswing with a dilution announcement.  It's like a penny stock, can't trust it.
Same unfortunately.
I bought it after it crashed and sold it when it rallied. I won.

Title: 87k Gain on Spy puts
Text: 
Top Comments: * spx and qqq puts. 

Adding text here, on old reddit can't be fucked to switch to make a post. 

Opened these positions early this week expecting that the market would eventually react to the threat of tariffs and uncertainty in Washington due to mass layoffs. Did I probably sell these too early? Most likely

Will look to re-enter this position with a smaller size in the coming days / weeks. I think we re-test and break through new lows IF tariffs are confirmed, but then again that's a big IF. Better to take the guaranteed gain right now. 

We will have much more room to go down once tariffs are enacted and I believe that the impact of them will be so monumentally bad that even waiting for their confirmation will lead to excessive profits. 

My biggest regret? Not buying a seat at this administration's table. Any regard with a phone and robinhood installed with $10-100k could turn that into hundreds of millions in a few months just being near the source of potentially market rattling information.
Everything except for SPY puts lmao but congrats anyway and fuck u
This is the way!
Whatcha gonna do with the money
Amazing, do it again!
